Someone spoke to this above... because if you have a teacher that is just terrible and doesn't know how to manage a class of mixed ability, you get very bored \\gifted\\\" students.  However, if the teacher knows how to differentiate properly, they can challenge your child, within the same confines of the concept being learned, at a deeper level.  Not just making your child do MORE work... but have your child do DIFFERENT work around the same topic.  Sometimes that can be as easy as asking one question to take it deeper.  _x0007__x0007_The problem I've seen with this, however, is that sometimes those \\\"gifted\\\" students still know in their head that they are getting different work.  They still think that they're smarter than the other kids, so they will tend to call the class boring.  Even though the teacher is definitely challenging the kid.  I've heard kids say, \\\"this class is easy\\\" when I KNOW I have challenged them with difficult questions on a daily basis that they struggle with.  I had a girl tell me my Honors Geometry class (as an 8th grader) was easy.  I laughed... I said, \\\"This class isn't EASY!  You just got an A on a High School Geometry Honors Mid-Term.  That's hard to do!  It's not easy... I watch you work HARD every day!  I see you thinking... I see you struggle... I watch you debate... This is work!   And you work hard!

It can help people feel like their contributions are interesting and important.  It could also be a good setting to develop good group discussion norms.  You also get to see how numbers are made up of other numbers, which leads into interesting things later.  (E.g. you can't do 15*12 = 15*10 + 15*2 without knowing that 12 can be broken into 10 and 2.

Now, it is back to tracking since it has been deemed important that 8th graders are able to take geometry if they want! The 8th grade need pushes back to everyone so we now need to start tracking again so we can, somewhere before middle school, get a group of the \\smartest\\\" kids to skip an entire grade so they are ready for geometry. The teachers from K-8 have made case after case as to why this is not good for children but it has fallen on deaf ears.

Many of my students in my classes are products of a failed public school system.

It is a second career for me; I was, in another life, an education program coordinator. So I have much to learn about teaching._x0007_And although my heart is in the right place it has been a struggle for me to try to help my students overcome this heavy belief that they are failures, especially when it comes to math. _x0007_Recently I was talking to a new colleague who just joined our staff this year, but who has been teaching for awhile. She was talking about the difficulty of teaching to so many different levels of ability in our classrooms. And she is right. We do have students with such a variety of strengths and ability who come from so many different backgrounds. So it is a dilemma how to catch the attention and interest of all. But I was horrified to hear her say that she grouped her students, that she felt it was the best way to teach to all skill levels. While I know that I lose many students (we all do in these programs) for whatever reasons and few finish out the semester, I do know that by the end of the semester I can look around my classroom and see all students working together. Yes my lesson planning and teaching are always a work in progress and I have so much room for improvement, but I almost cry to think of the adults in her classes who are assigned to their group and subtly told, this is it for you, I am confirming your negative sense of your abilities. This and no higher. But until this course and the information on the brain research and mind-set for growth, formative teaching, I had no words to counter her oh so reasonable pronouncements.

She helped me to believe in myself as a critical reader of fiction and nonfiction texts. On the other hand, a single message can also have a very negative impact. My high school math teacher helped cement my lack of self-confidence in math by very obviously patting me on the head and moving on during a difficult lesson which I was struggling to understand. Whether he intended it or not, the message I felt was, \\Don't worry your pretty little head about it.\\\" I felt ashamed and stupid, and this further undermined any desire on my part to ever be noticed in math class.

I am speaking from my own experiences here.  No one ever told me that I shouldn't be good at math because I am female.  The first time I ever encountered gender issues in a math class was in a graduate level math class (a male student tried to dominate the class), during the same semester in which I was taking a class in which I was looking at gender issues._x0007_I wonder about news coverage sometimes.  In discussing race related issues, t.v. anchors often review the history of race relations.  I'm not sure that that type of coverage is particularly helpful.  The other item I feel needs to be handled with caution are classroom practices, such as speed and timed tests.  While I think that is good information, I am concerned about undermining a teacher's authority.  So, if you do provide information about speed being harmful in the student course, talk to the students about ways to talk to their teachers about these topics without being confrontational."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Maybe periodically in class you can call students who are needing extra help or anyone who wants extra help to meet at a table while the class might be working on an assignment to give remedial help.  I don't know.  Then hopefully those self-help (remedial) type groups don't fit the ability grouping that can often have a negative stigma attached to them.

You have a participation quiz where you tell the students \\Today I'm going to be assessing how well you work as a team, and in particular, I will be looking at how well you perform in your role.\\\" This sets the expectation that you want students to ALL be involved, not just some of them.

I think in part because of this mind set as well as society's trend toward immediate answers/gratification, they are reluctant to persevere and struggle with problems. They really want a recipe/methodology for just completing the problems quickly and without true understanding. I have also found that many of the students don't realize that they math they take is cumulative. They memorize what they need to pass the current course, but because it they didn't connect with it/truly understand it in the first place, it is difficult/impossible to keep it in memory and use in later math classes in the algebra sequence. _x0007__x0007_So I think, some of the problem is foundational, prerequisite knowledge being weak and not taught properly (and with the time needed for everyone to truly understand it). I agree with the comment posted about elementary teachers are often afraid of math and feel that they are \\\"not good\\\" with math - so this cycle just inadvertently continues onto with their students. So enter choice, A - I think the teaching methods and perhaps who is even teaching math at lower levels could be part of the problem too.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

One question I would like to know what's everybody's idea is that do you believe that in high school we should place students in the right level math class? In Canada, high school we have three level of math class, Academic/University level, Applied/college level and basic/workplace. To register for each math class depends student & their parents, there is no qualification requested. Therefore a lot time in my grade 9/10 academic/university level course students only have grade 5/6 level of basic math skill. I find that it is very difficult for me to engage them, they feel bad and lost most of the time. I often to suggest them to take one level lower to start then later to come back to high level mat class. I am not sure if I am doing the right thing or there will have some other ways I can teach them better....Looking forward to hearing your thoughts."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

I struggle with the idea that leveling is bad.  Within each class I have huge ranges of abilities.  My classes are hardly homogeneous groupings.  For example this past year in Pre-Algebra (not leveled classes) I had students who didn't know their basic math facts and couldn't solve the most basic equations without assistance and students who could complete each task assigned with proficiency.  In Pre-Algebra I was working under the (soon to be dismissed) California State Standards.  My Math 6 classes were not leveled.  I was working under the Common Core State Standards for these classes.  I was able (for the most part) to provide challenging activities so that the high, at grade level, and low students were all able to solve and make progress towards mastering the standards.  I often saw the high students become the students of the low students.  The low students often had a better understanding of the process (and got hung up on the arithmetic) than the high students who had memorized the algorithm (process) for solving that type of problem. _x0007__x0007_That is what I love about education. Every class and every year is different.  It is our job as educators to present the material so it is challenging to the majority of the students.

As long as you offer many challenging tasks you will reach all the students."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

You are not going to have kindergarten students in the same math class with high school students.  We are going to draw lines and group students according to some criterion.  Why does it make more sense to do it by age than by ability?  When I take yoga, I go to a beginner class, because if I go to the advanced class I will get hurt.  And the advanced students would be bored if they had to take class with me.  It would be an additional burden and water down the class if we required all yoga teachers to teach to all levels in the same class.  It just doesn't make sense.  Clearly ability grouping in math does impact students in all sorts of negative ways.  But is this more a product of the culture this video describes than the actual logic of having different levels?  What would we say about someone who said I am not going to take piano because my friend is in the fourth book and my teacher wants me to start in the first book?  We need to provide quality material at all levels and teach students to divorce their self-image from whatever level they are currently (applies to a lot of adults too), not trade age grouping for ability grouping."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

I used this opportunity to share the following ideas with my classes.   I believe the ability to think about mistakes and learn from them is the most useful skill on the list.  I talked about the value of errors and how mistakes cause your brain to grow.  When you make a mistake, research says your brain develops new synapses.  I hope to challenge them so that they can learn from each others errors.  I explained that my goals for the year are to develop their thinking and communication skills._x0007__x0007_2.\tI used their responses to form my groups by considering grade, sex and thinking strengths.  I constructed groups so each one reflected a variety of thinking strengths.   _x0007_     _x0007_I also teach a traditional curriculum.  I cannot do inquiry based, but I discovered that you can make a small change that makes a big difference.  All you have to do is change WHEN you ask a question.  Ask a question you would normally ask, before the lesson and try to find one that has multiple entry points or several ways to solve it.  Let the students struggle and discuss and you answer questions.  The lesson comes from students presenting their work.  Afterwards as a class you organize their methods and fill in any gaps.  I usually try to find a couple more problems that are different but involve the same concepts.  These are not drill or skill problem"}], "max_tokens": 3}}

At the high school level I have had this discussion with kids very openly.  _x0007_I may recommend a more advanced class, and they say they want to spend more time studying literature or psychology, that their interest is not in mathematics.  Great - let me help you get what you need._x0007_On the other hand, I have had students really lobby to be in a more challenging placement.  90% of the time they were correct and exceeded my expectations.  I think it is important to respect the learner.  To let them have a voice in the decision making process._x0007__x0007_Similarly, this year in my new school we have two levels \\college prep\\\" and \\\"honors\\\".  Many of my college prep geometry students asked to move into the honors level next class - now this is tricky because I don't truly know how solid their algebra skills are (I have some idea, but not the whole picture)nor do I really know the difference between the classes as this is a new school for me - but I asked my students 3 questions:_x0007_(1) Are you willing to put in extra time as needed to learn the material?_x0007_(2) Are you willing to accept a grade that is not an \\\"A\\\" - as you may find it difficult at first making the adjustment?_x0007_(3) Are you willing to seek extra help - either through your teacher, tutor, or even me?_x0007__x0007_If they could answer yes to all three then I recommended the honors class.  Not sure how our department head will feel about that, but you know, if the student is willing to struggle a little, then we should let them struggle.  I know that those honors teachers will keep their break-neck speed for the higher students and any kid that showed interest in moving up will be fine.  But some of the difference in 2 levels goes to allowing for some choice at the high school level.  They don't have choice as to whether or not they take mathematics, however it is helpful to have choice in how much time/energy they would like to give to the different subjects.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Because it works for me, I also rhetorically ask \\will the floor open and swallow him if he's wrong?\\\" or \\\"will anyone die if she makes a mistake?\\\" In addition, especially during math, I remind them to be watching carefully because I make frequent mistakes, or get confused. Often, if someone catches a mistake I'm making, I give them a point,and invite them up to show us their thinking. Occasionally, I'm not wrong, but the student works through a confusion (which others usually share). Similarly, students routinely come up to demonstrate how they got answers. Time permitting, we have people show all the different ways they arrived at the answer. Those who get different answers come up, partly so we can resolve the issue, figure out how and why different answers arose -- which one is \\\"right,\\\" and what error in thinking or calculation caused the mistake. Sometimes students can identify where another student has a confusion before I can, and explain it better, since they have already \\\"been there,\\\" and worked through the error.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

I think the class system is so engrained in England they don't even recognize that they are training students to be an underclass. I found the last sentence interesting ( and correct!) Every class has to be differentiated anyway, so either students are in the wrong set OR if each lesson is differentiated, what is the need for sets? Just use more open ended problems that can be accessed on many levels.

Not everything has to be a problem-based learning. Indeed, much research suggests that problem-based learning works better if a student has background knowledge. Notice, no where did I say that the problem-based learning needs to be exactly like the procedures already taught. By giving students a path, they can be prepared to think deeper and in a different way. Also, repeated attempts at the same procedures in novel concepts increases memorization and understanding. _x0007__x0007_There should be a mix! So many want to act like worksheets are fake and problem-based learning is authentic. Learning comes in all different styles and methods; for example, Japan does a great deal of memorization before problem-based learning. Other countries, like Germany, do very little problem-based learning. Yet, both countries are at the top of the world's math tests. The point is that like solving a math problem, there are several paths to teaching."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

But some time in college, I seemed to have a better grasp of the subject.  I feel like to be successful in math(or any subject) is that you have to have an inquiry for it (which we are all born with), it must be presented in a way that is somewhat accesible and there has to be some perseverance and \\risk taking\\\" on the part of the student.  In my classroom, I try to stoke the inquiry by presenting problems that are accessible and somewhat open ended. But getting student's to take a risk, try the problem for an hour or day can be tough because they have been conditioned to think that solving a math problem is something on the magnitude of minutes rather than hours or even days.  So it comes as no surprise that completion level of college math is low.  By the time they get to those classes, the inquiry and fun has been driven out of them in favor of a quick solution that you either get or don't and this idea of toughness/perseverance is non-existant.  My goal as a math teacher is to try to build this back up and encourage the risk taking.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

The real power of the number talk was to dig into how students are solving problems and making sense of the number. During the discussion, the teacher is drawing a visual to help students 'see' the number as well as writing the number sentence that makes it up. Very powerful. It helps make numbers concrete."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

When talking to teachers and administrators and the bean counters things start to break down. It seems it is usually left up to an individual teacher who is willing to put the effort in to break away from this mould, hardly ever a concerted policy or whole system approach. It is very convenient from, a bean counting perspective, to have all the kids nicely categorised and grouped so that they go through the nicely organised day that starts with a bell ringing at 9:00 am then every 50 minutes after that - just like the work and world of the future will be if we were living in the 1800s!!!

She encouraged the student who recognized his mistake to share it - talk through it, which he did comfortably; evidently the culture of this classroom highlights mistakes as a welcomed/important part of the learning experience. The teacher also represented on the board in numbers/operations and in pictorial graphs student thinking as the deconstruction of numbers and then again as the flexible rearrangement of them. She asked critical thinking questions of her students, while she showed on the board many ways to think about solving the problem as well as the many solutions that students came up with.

I think what the course is trying to show us is that even though students may perform better in the short term when grouped by ability, it has long term negative impacts on their learning. What we need to do is plan classroom activities that allow all students to participate, but by design, the activities let each student take part \\at their level\\\". For example, in the division problem shown earlier in this session, the teacher didn't group the students by ability. Instead, everyone got the same problem and the same task, \\\"Make sense of this division problem.\\\" They all approached it differently, and even students who were \\\"advanced\\\" and already knew the algorithm were still challenged to understand how other students were solving the problem. That's just one example of differentiation. It takes more planning on the part of the teacher, but once she is experienced with it, it will be much easier and the students will benefit more in the long term.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

It's difficult though and you can see it on their faces when they've worked so hard. The problem with the extended classes for these bright, wonderful thinkers is how fast they crack through the content. I've had wonderful middle schoolers unravel in HS maths because there was no time to breathe let alone think or try to solve something a different way. I saw them again two years later and had to restore their mathematical belief in themselves. These extended classes (depending on the school I suppose) support rapidity. It's a big problem in Grade 10 when the teachers have to submit, by March assessments using all of the criteria and this must include a test. _x0007__x0007_I will be teaching in a small school so no grouping is possible. We will all be doing the same tasks but hopefully open and differentiated. _x0007__x0007_At a school in Sydney, 1999 (not an IB school) I was given the \\bottom class\\\" at a girls school in the outer western suburbs. They did not have a positive feeling about mathematics or themselves as learners or being smart. We had some discussions about what had been covered, progress, was there anything they had enjoyed that year (I came in half way through) and if not what about any year before that?_x0007__x0007_Their test scores were very low and everyone sat the same final exam (in grade 8!). _x0007_They seemed to agree that shapes and geometry were okay so I suggested we look at it in depth and ignore the rest unless we found the time. I told them we would all learn something really well rather than trying to get through all of it. They agreed. _x0007_Of course there is numeracy and algebra in geometry, but I didn't call it that, they were just tools to solve problems. Out of seven classes, our class came fourth (averages). What a proud group of girls. I think this is where I found my love of teaching the so called \\\"bottom\\\" groups or achievers.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Respond with only one of the options shown and label the following text: One thing that has worked in my elementary school is the introduction of daily word problems.  Our administration believes that using math story problems in our classrooms can give every student a chance to develop understanding of basic math concepts.  This has been highly successful.  First, we introduce a real life situation based on our math objective.  We then have the students tell each other the story and what the specific task is.  We then have the students use unifix cubes, drawings, numerical representations of how they solve the problem, using at least one representation that can be put down on paper.  This lets all level of achievers to use whatever forum they want. When higher students finish, we give them the task to solve it another way and show their thinking. As students work individually, the teacher goes around and asks students what they are showing (how they are making sense of their thinking) and selects three students to present their strategies to the class.  These presentations are to be from simple to more complex so that all students can see/relate their thinking to another way of solving the problem.  This has been highly successful in our school practices and has shown us that all students can do math.  I found that at the end of doing this for an entire year, most if not all students were able to express their math thinking with ease and were more than eager to share and be presenters to the class.  I noticed doing daily math word problems also obliterated the anxiety that often accompanies such problems.  Last year, one of my students exclaimed, \\I'm not afraid of story problems anymore.\\\"  This was all the proof I needed.  I'm continuing this practice!\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

For me it was to strengthen my patience muscles and tolerate others more easily.

The idea that students are not good at math or that is a difficult subject is so societal in nature and reflects back on families, schools and communities. The message used to be more gender based in that it was more difficult for girls than boys. but I think that mindset is shifting, albeit quite slowly.The pressure for math comes from the arbitrary expectation that everyone is a linear thinker and can process mathematical concepts in a set time format and at a pace set by school administrators. Dr. Montessori was a leading reformist in this thought and developed a three year cycle following the developmental needs and tendencies for students. She developed great math and geometry materials that enables learners to learn kinesthetically through the manipulation of materials._x0007_<nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>"}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Or what if that was the year you moved from one school district / state / country to the next and there was a gap between the two schools?

Mistakes are important because they help our brains to grow new neurons and make new connections.  Every time we make a mistake and then go back and work on it again, our brains change, they grow stronger and smarter. If you get a math problem right, there's not a whole lot going on in your brain because you probably already knew how to do it.  If all the work I give you is easy, then I'm cheating you out of new learning.  If you get a math problem wrong, it's time to try out other ideas and persist with figuring it out.  Doing this is really cool because it will actually cause your brain to form new connections -- this is REAL LEARNING.  Your brain is actually growing and getting stronger every time you make a mistake and return to it to experiment with new and different ideas.  We're going to have so much fun trying out a lot of different ideas to figure out really cool and challenging math questions, just like scientists, doctors and computer experts do in their jobs every day.

It was my first year teaching, and I am working at building my toolbox. Last year I focused on getting out the very basic tools, so that I could consult them and build from them. Additionally it serves as a great tool for students to download if they missed class. However, because PowerPoint is rather boring at times, I have spruced them up with several common features. The first common feature is what I call the moment of zen. At the end of the lesson, I show an inspiring picture and share a mini lesson about the picture (usually not math related). I then proceed to the the Homework slide (which will now be called the homepractice slide), it has the assignment listed. However, it also has an inspirational quote. I tend to try to focus the quotes on ideas that surround growth mindset, education, and appreciation of self and others. (sometimes the quotes are humorous)._x0007__x0007_I am also working at plugging in the \\Pause and Ponder\\\" questions.

No students are allowed to straight out answer the question (as they are often open questions, this isn't a problem), but instead the students should sit quietly and ponder the questions. Then they can discuss the question with their partner/group. Then we discuss it as a class. It is my intention to make this a bigger part of the my presentations next year.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

I see this as a challenge to help the kids work in groups to solve problems beyond their expected abilities.

Then again, students are only taught the equation of a circle in year 12 (Age 16/17)._x0007__x0007_This task feels like the students have all been taught the mechanical skills parts and are now using those skills in problem solving._x0007__x0007_I have a question for Jo Boaler:  How are the students taught the mechanical skills required for this task? Are they taught using formative assessment or using the traditional method?  _x0007__x0007_It seems to me (and I may be wrong) that the lesson plan includes four out of the five strategies needed for complete formative assessment.  Although I guess I may be being picky and so four is enough.  The missing strategy is: Sharing and clarifying learning intentions and success criteria.  It doesnt feel that time or thought has been dedicated to discussing where the students are going._x0007__x0007_The rest of the lesson plan has elements of engineering activities to elicit learning, Using students as resources for one another, Activating students as owners of their own learning and Using feedback to move learning forward.  Many of the techniques expressed in the lesson are very familiar to me and I have been attempting them in class for the past seven years:_x0007__x0007_Recently I discovered that three students in a group is the optimum amount (British Psychological Society) so that is pleasing to see.  The growth mindset is that group is big enough for different dialogue and small enough not to put some students off talking.  All students will be participating, which doesnt always happen with larger groups.  There is more chance of effective, critical and fresh feedback ideas._x0007__x0007__x0007_I also use the independent and joint solution strategy.  This encourages a growth mindset by firstly allowing students personal time to think and have-a-go on their own. Secondly, valuing other students learning in a respectful and attentive way.  Thirdly by offering constructive feedback.  Students often prefer to listen to classmates critiquing rather than the teacher in my experience. _x0007__x0007_I particularly like the list of questions and prompts for feedback and the ideas on how to convey these to students.  This in itself doesnt necessarily encourage a growth mindset, but the Directed Improvement and Reflection Time does and makes the students actively Think "}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Our students are put in class based on their reading scores, not math.

I find it challenging to work with students with so different skills and constantly looking for new ways of engaging everyone and giving them opportunities to learn regardless of their math levels. I believe that my students are better off by being in the same group. However, sometimes it can be very difficult to keep everyone developing and engaged. What I found works great is when students work in small groups on problems that require them to figure out answers (there is no one best way to do a problem). Also, I develop a set of questions for students who might be \\stuck\\\" and for students who are done with the assignment and need a challenge. I found that students really like to create their own similar problems and ask their classmates to solve those. My lower level students show incredible improvements over the course of the semester, although sometimes they need more than 14 weeks to get to the GED math level. The students who need to do another semester are more willing to come back to school again as they grow to understand that developing math skill takes time.

Another intervention, included naming a particular method for solving a problem after the person who created it. For example , Mindy's theorem or John's Method.

By nature we group our students by levels and teach each student on their instruction level. Last year I had a group of 6th graders I was working with which I was giving very remedial work to. They were able to do this work and were successful. But when they went back to their regular education classroom they were very lost in math and wanted to know how to do that math. So, a few months into school I decided to just \\re-teach\\\" what they were learning in their other classroom. I showed them how to use tools like calculators to solve problems and showed them how to organize their thinking while doing math. They were SO successful. They LOVED the harder work, and even though it took them a lot longer to solve the problems than with the remedial work, they loved it and loved being challenged. If we assume that they can't do math you aren't giving them the chance to grow and learn.

I think you bring up interesting points and they made me think.  I agree that she allowed mistakes and chose not to take apart those mistakes or examine them as a whole class.  But I think that while the students might not have known exactly WHY the process that led them to 6 was the wrong process, they understood that 6 couldn't be the answer because it's too big.  I perceived the wood problem as being more of a counter-example (why it couldn't be 6) than a proof (why it had to be 1 and a half).  I think if we want students to be able to distinguish on their own between good and bad reasoning, we have to let them have some time to wrestle with different explanations without telling them which work and which don't.  I admired the way in which this teacher allowed that wrestle time to happen.  I know I sometimes set up good think time for my students but accidentally give away the answer through my tone of voice."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

They often do not know place values, and they almost always have no home support or divided support between split households._x0007__x0007_The remainder of the 31 kids are well past that.

Since California did away with the 20 to 1 classroom size, all grades (K-5) have 30 or 31 kids. The ones who arrive unprepared in Kinder often lag behind.  A few catch up by third, but it is pretty common for the kid to be three or four grade levels behind in math by fifth grade for this group.  The district does not supply aides.

These experiences can make such an impact in the way kids interact with each other. Teachers need to teach students to share their own learning experiences in a way that is beneficial for all without putting down others. There is a lot of work in the beginning of the year around teaching healthy interactions among students I think, especially in the middle school ages.

I started teaching him with the Singapore Math module ten years ago and noticed that when I did, his standardized score would increase. I tried to let the school do their work and his math score were much lower. The teachers said that all children get bad grades sometimes. I responded that our household does not accept lower grades. By the time my son reached 6 Grade he was hating school and math. This was shocking to me because this was the child who had memorized every name of dinosaurs and loved learning about insects at age 4. At that point, I took a leap of courage and faith and chose to home school him until high school. His level and joy of accomplishment soared extremely high again. He then was able to test into a math STEM program in our area! _x0007_I became concerned again because he began to tell me that math was boring again.

Additionally, I would assume once students see other students' ideas, they might begin to see relationships between numbers and ideas that they might not have seen before and also see that everyone's ideas are considered important and not better than anyone else's - perhaps allowing students to think of themselves and others as being capable in math.  The different methods that are discussed can also help students have a better sense of operations, properties, algorithms, and algebraic thinking as they begin to see another layer of math thinking that isn't about the answer or a calculation.  These talks also engage everyone somewhat equally because there isn't one person who raises their hand and gets the answer correct.  It would seem it could hold the attention better if all of the students know they might be asked to share and it would be potentially more engaging to have many people active and discussing, raising the interest level.  Seeing different ways of doing math problems would seem to help students become more flexible in number thinking and better at decomposing math problems and so increase the ability to understand relationships within our number system - the key to further math success."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

We have mixed group classes. However, with RtI (Response to Intervention) we are creating classes that will help students that have some need or additional support. These classes can be quite challenging because within an intervention class, many of the students will have different needs. What I have found is mathematically, these students are all at the same relative level. Therefore, I still see tracking happening within the district, but because it is called something different, it is alright to group these students together. This is the second year we are running this program, and we have seen great improvement in the group of students that have been identified in needing additional support. In fact, we have been so successful in seeing these students in a mixed class with an additional support class that we are now offering a year 2 class for math support."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Often, these programs move VERY quickly from topic to topic and never really go in-depth with any of the concepts. In other words, they simply teach a procedure, and move on without ever teaching the students WHY that works. With the implementation of the Common Core Learning Standards, this is supposed to change. I hope that students will gain a more solid foundation so that they are more successful when they are expected to put concepts together."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

We often talk about how we can better prepare our students for college mathematics in our department.  Currently we decided that we need to separate students by both course and age. The reasoning for this separation is the feeling that the older students in an algebra 1 or geometry course bring that extra baggage of fear or hate of mathematics that can so easily be transferred to the younger students.  It has improved our test scores but I do not think we have changed any attitudes towards mathematics or un-tramatized any math injured brains of the upper classman at our school. So I would have to conclude that this data is related to what is happening at my school. _x0007__x0007_I am looking for ways to put the fun back into mathematics for my students.  By the time they reach high school they already hate math and feel that they are not good at it.  It does not matter how much you tell them that if they do not pass with a C or better that they will not get into a 4 year college or university - they still hate mathematics and are not willing to put in the time to master the concepts and skills needed to understand the material and go on to the next level."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

I told them it was okay to get mad at me and it was okay to share frustrations. We started the very first week by brainstorming what they thought would be hard about the expectation and what scared them the most. Then we set about choosing sentence starters and questions that would help them sort through their fears and navigate discussions in a productive way. I also had to stop and take a lot of calming breaths and remind myself to ignore time and address the mistakes in the prescribed manner. I think my own brain grew a lot this year considerring the number of mistakes I made in responding to mistakes. However, the kids were really willing to let me take a do over and say that's not the way I want to respond to mistakes...let's go back and see what we can learn here.

Maths is optional after 16, at the moment. You might get algebra coming up in trigonometry or probability. It isn't always taught well, and many of the students find maths difficult, and do not like it, so I'm very conscious that many of the problems with maths education are international.

As the math interventionist I become nervous that the children are not given strategies that are different to learn the material. I also see this as a way to push close mindedness. I would like to see us deal more with project based than proficiency based as we have set things up. In our current model many class rooms allow the students to do work sheet after worksheet - assess and move on. My favorite class rooms allow the students to look at problems, discuss, hypothesize, and express answers in writing, on video or in project form. I am not able to convince our administration that the children who are doing worksheet after worksheet are given a disservice in the long run. I like the proficiency because it allows the students to move forward - those teachers who teach whole groups will often give out word problems or problem solving materials at different levels that the students discuss and work with together.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Some skipped facts can be as simple as adding and subtracting integers or fractions. The students I have worked with often have these misconceptions and required re-teaching in order to advance. _x0007_But it's unfair to put the blame on the teacher solely. Students are embarrassed to ask their teachers questions out of fear of their peers. They fear of being mocked and ridiculed. I also have met students who truly believe they are terrible in math and give up the moment they make a mistake. They fear of failing so they avoid doing the work in the first place. It's frustrating to see children with low self-esteem and a closed-mind about themselves. But changing their beliefs cannot be made in a day. Sometimes it takes weeks, sometimes years. Sometimes I can't reach them at all and I don't see them the following school year.  It's hard to tell if algebra is difficult if the student doesn't try in the first place."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Our lessons are rich task-wise and we do not 'rely on the textbook'.

We actually had some mixed ability teaching in years 7 and 8 and I did not enjoy teaching these classes, I felt completely out of my depth. However, recently I have been wondering if setting is the right thing. We seem to have more problematic students in 'low' sets and these groups definitely think they are 'no good' at maths.

Ask the question first. It can be a question you already have, and it does not have to be a great open ended question. Do this right from the beginning of the year so it sets the \\tone.\\\"  You will get complaints at first that you are not \\\"teaching\\\" but the students adjust. Find a problem that has more than one way to do it. Don't show them what to do, just let them work and ask questions.  Hopefully you will get more than one solution to discuss with the class. For example- Give the students 3 ordered pairs and ask if they are all on the same line.  It can be done by graphing, comparing slopes, writing the equation a line through 2 points and showing the third point is on it, or using distances.  If a student finds one method quickly, challenge him to find another. _x0007__x0007_2.  Don't label or tell the students the \\\"topic\\\" of a problem before you do the problem.  This takes away the necessity of thinking about what skill to use.  AFTER you have finished the problem ask the students how they think the problem should be labeled.  What was the key idea?  What skills did they need?_x0007__x0007_3.  Take the scaffolding out of the problem and let the students figure out what they need to do. Let them decide on their own process.  Sometimes you will be surprised; they find methods better than yours. Have the students work in groups and you can walk around to answer questions and give hints if necessary.  When the class is done, the students can generalize the thought process or procedure for the solution._x0007__x0007_4.  If you review, don't go in any order or have labels on the problems.  Mix everything together so the students have to think and figure out what concepts apply._x0007__x0007_5.  When I test, I always make sure there are a couple of problems that require concepts from previous units. If there is concept from an earlier unit that caused difficulty, revisit it during class and include it on the next test.  If a student thinks he is never going to be asked about a topic again, he will not remediate.  There needs to be incentive to corre\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

While it can be learned alone, I believe that it is learned best with a group of people.  If all of those   The best way to learn math is to share ideas (e.g. convince myself, convince a friend, convince an enemy) If the students in a group all have the same low ability, there is no one there to speak the language of math.  Oftentimes in a mixed group, those who are 'low' actually see the concepts of the math the best.  Often our high achievers are only 'high' because they have been taught methods and procedures and have memorized their math facts.  They are not necessarily better mathematicians. My biggest educational 'wish' is that all students would have the opportunities afforded to the upper class.  How can schools/society make that happen?

I feel like sometimes it is nice to have a group that is all about at the same place, but then it is a large group and when there is need, it is hard to meet all their needs at the same time.  Our district is pushing students to take more advanced level classes, and instead of having them grouped according to their grades, etc, students have the choice of a regular class or an advanced class.  This sometimes becomes frustrating for me because I feel like I am teaching the same things in both classes, and having to try to reach all spectrum in both classes because there are many students that aren't truly ready for advanced work yet.  I do believe that grouping them together often boosts their confidence, and students that are often behavior problems and struggling in a regular math class, often become great achievers in an advanced class because they are pushed.

Respond with only one of the options shown and label the following text: I was at a math workshop earlier this week, and during the lunch break, I heard a member of my staff admiring the way another school tracked their students into a low, middle and high math group. I didn't say anything at the time, but reflected on when this was done during my teaching in England, and how much I disagreed with it. I taught the low group which was by far the largest group, and they barely fit into the room. They knew they were the low group and it is clearly a blow to the self-esteem.  If that ever comes up as a suggestion at my school, I will share your videos and research with the staff.  _x0007_I now teach at the <redacted: [Canadian provice]>. I have a very diverse group of students.  I differentiate in order to meet their needs. We typically do a whole-class lesson using the Smart Board, sometimes using manipulatives. I try to give as many students a chance to use the SB to solve problems and share ideas.  Once the work has been assigned, I will give those who \\switch off\\\" one-on-one help, and assign them maybe only a few questions to focus on . The quick-finishers can play one of the many math games I have available, or take an extra practice sheet that I have available.  Whatever they do, it has to be math related.  Sometimes, if I check their work I find that they really haven't gotten it yet, and I'll send them back for corrections. If they really have aced it, then I will ask if they'd like to peer-tutor other students. It's a much more friendly, collaborative, inclusive environment.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

However, I remember about a year ago I went to a \\teaching in honors\\\" workshop (knowing I'll probably never be \\\"chosen\\\" to be an honors professor), where we discussed for several hours what it means to teach an honors course. It was drilled to us that honors doesn't mean \\\"give students more work\\\", rather, we should be using a different approach with them to get them to a higher level of understanding. After leaving that workshop, I was angry. Why are the honors students given a budget for field trips, small class sizes, and the best professors who are actively encouraged to find ways to try new innovative methods that entice students to reach the higher levels of Bloom's taxonomy (or whatever learning hierarchy you subscribe to)? I feel like we've given up on all but the highest level students, never giving the \\\"bottom\\\" 95% of students a chance to achieve that highest level._x0007__x0007_At the university I intended it was similar. If you wanted to be in the honors program, you had to place in the honors program (based on high school performance) upon entering. Why? Are we so locked in to the mindset as a society that students are naturally smart, that smart students will always stay smart and the rest will never reach that potential?\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

And what kind of message is that to give to a child!?  _x0007_Also it seems to me that sometimes we group for scheduling conveniences. It's difficult to place a child who may do well in one subject but not so well in the others. In these groupings we don't take into account individual strength and weaknesses because it's so much less time consuming to lump children together.  _x0007_I am greatly concerned about the message these grouping send because it's labeling a child.

I personally can remember when I was in first grade the 'big project' was a report on dinosaurs.

Respond with only one of the options shown and label the following text: Once students get put in a lower track, as a teacher, I see more behavior problems. They believe that they can't do the math. They struggle, or don't even know how to start. They feel dumb and think that anything would be better that staying in this class, and letting their peers see them struggle and be stupid. Acting out can get them attention, even if it is negative. They can get out of class, if they are too disruptive. If they get to leave, their peers won't see how hard this math really is. The problem is that once they get used to acting out, it is very hard to go back to a system of no tracking. All it takes is a couple of students who are disruptive, and the entire class suffers. We went to no tracking for one year, and the teachers didn't like it due to disruptive students. Should Special Education students be put in a regular class? These students are easily intimidated, and don't feel comfortable letting other students know how much they struggle. What if they can't keep up with the rest of the class. What about students who are a year or more advanced? Many of them have had more opportunities, sometimes put in Hi-Cap, (High Capabilities), classes. Would everyone excel if they were given the same opportunities? What about kids who don't want to put out very much effort? It seems that some students are just lazy or unmotivated. What about students who are absent a lot? At our school, we can have students who are absent 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 or more days. What about students who get put in Juvenile Hall, and are not there for instruction? What about students who are suspended and are not there for 45 days, because they get in trouble for drugs or alcohol? In our school district, students are passed on each year, regardless of their grades. The rules change when they get to high school. All of a sudden class are for credit with only a D and above given as a passing grade. Is a D student really going to do well in the second year of math, when they have not demonstrated that they know the material from the first year? I do not feel that these studies have addressed these issues."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

They are not pegged into one group for the whole year.  My groups change as often as the skill or concept has been learned.  Some students exit the group quickly and sometimes others move in.  Many times what many would consider a traditionally high student will be with a traditionally low student because they both need practice with a particular skill or concept.  I don't need to slow down a whole group of students because one needs a lesson, nor do I stop a student from learning something new simply because the others in the group are not ready.

In my own 10th grade experience, I struggled and suffered with honors geometry. In many ways, I think that teachers in my previous years had not prepared me for the rigors of writing a geometric proof. Today as a math coach, many of the teachers that I have coached are afraid of geometry and leave their grade level's topics to as late in the year as possible. The results are more students unprepared to function on a van Hiele level of geometric understanding needed to be successful in an honors geometry course. Add in the lack of experience/training in technology like Geometer's Sketchpad and the past repeats itself. As a workshop presenter, I have written and presented several workshops over the past 10 years in an attempt to end this cycle. There is so much more to be done, though._x0007_My hope for this course is that I will develop more strategies to help both students and teachers be successful in mathematics."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

The stamps are supposed to be about where the student wants to end up after high school (university, college or the work place), but in reality they are ability groupings. I find that students coming into high school have significantly different levels of understanding of the basic math skills. Students in the top group can manipulate fractions and integers and problem solve with good success, and those in the lowest group have difficulty adding and subtracting without a calculator. As the curriculum demands specific standards for different courses, I feel these groups are still necessary (and we have ways for students to move between levels), but even within each group there is still differing ability._x0007_     Perhaps grouping in grade 9 is a good time to start diff entailing the materials that students receive. I have wondered, however, about the students in our lowest group and have been curious about the last math experience that they had which they actually understood before they were grouped....I fear that it would have been several years when they sat in a math class and didn't understand anything. For those students I wonder how earlier grouping might help them."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

By using the dot cards, you can actually gain the same discussion and build the conceptual understanding, but it allows you to really see the many ways people may attack the same problem.

We did a lot of collaboration activities. _x0007_Now as a mother of four, it frustrates me to see in our school what they call heterogeneous grouping with an 'inclusion cluster/focus cluster/esl cluster imbedded within the classes.

I said to some of the upset ones, \\What if it were your son or daughter who belonged in the higher class, but because of numbers your child were put in the lower class?\\\"  No one would answer. I finally got my way, but there were grade restrictions put on them. If any one got a C in the higher class they would have to be moved. (I tell you, I worked so hard with some of those border line kids trying to be sure they did not get a C. I did lose one, but the rest did great and all moved on to the next level.) _x0007_I have also asked that my 6th graders be split all boys in one class, and all girls in the other.

Colleagues who teach lower track classes often say material is too difficult for their students.  They want to skip topics, give students \\cheat sheets\\\" or scaffold every problem.  They have a title or target goal on problems but this eliminates the student's need to decide what skills to use.  Part of doing mathematics is sorting and applying skills when appropriate. They don't give their students a chance to struggle and grow, because they don't believe in their students.  The most common talk now is about differentiated instruction, but this just tracking inside a classroom.  The students still know which group is doing the easier work and which group the more challenging, and it is more work for the teacher.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Two years ago, in 3rd grade (which is the grade I teach) our administrator asked the 3rd grade team to split our students by ability for reading.  We did this for several reasons, but primarily because we had to document for RTI (Response to Intervention) for those students reading below grade level.  We used several tools to determine where to place children and the children were never told that they were being \\grouped\\\", just that we were changing teachers for reading groups. [And, yes, some of them could figure out what we were doing.]  The groups were fluid, however, so that if a child made significant progress in reading ability, he or she was \\\"moved\\\" to another teacher (essentially another/higher group).  What we discovered was that those children who were so very low that they couldn't read was that once they were placed in a very small class, they began to participate more AND their reading difficulties became more obvious.  Why? Because suddenly those children could not disappear into the larger group.  They felt more at ease responding because they were in the same boat as everyone else at the reading table.  Most of those children made huge strides in their reading levels._x0007__x0007_As a teacher I noticed that even though we used several tools, some children were incorrectly placed.

We were expected to be good in math (and science, mom was a biology teacher) and to \\learn it the old-fashioned way\\\" - watch daddy do it, practice what daddy did, [know how to] do it alone. Dad never asked us if it connected to anything else that made sense, if we had a different way of thinking about it or making sense of it or what we thought (and certainly not how we felt). When we made mistakes, it was not pleasant - we frequently heard \\\"why can't you do this, why did you get it wrong, you're not stupid, you must not have studied hard enough or practiced long enough!\\\" My sister (who skipped 2 grades) would be in tears but I was a much more stubborn kid who didn't cry, already knew I wasn't stupid, and was lucky in memorizing procedures (I skipped 1 grade). Classroom instruction was no better - both of us experienced the pressure of quick and correct answers, and blackboard embarrassment. Sis developed ELA skills to become a writer, lawyer and executive; I became a teacher with a doctorate in math ed. I recently found out how profoundly negative and sustaining my sister's math learning experiences had been - despite her use of math to manage multimillion dollar corporate accounts in her career and personal portfolio accounts, she says \\\"I'm not good at math!\\\" And when I'm feeling just a little mean, I know I can bring sis to tears if I invoke her memories of 11th grade math class drills. Needless to say I now know so much more about math, affect, and math learning and teaching - I imagine my dad and I would have very interesting conversations.

So by just talking to them about feelings and mistakes and how we care about them I hope will have a huge impact.  I am really excited for the school year to start next week!"}], "max_tokens": 3}}

I would have thought that grouping are no barrier to encouraging growth mindsets - as long as you explain that these groupings are there to provide the right amount of support. In my school the lowest set was also the smallest, allowing greater contact time with the students, and the top set was the largest, and I can't see how this would be possible without grouping by ability. The ability to go at a faster pace in higher sets to keep students motivated, and in the lower sets to think more slowly and carefully is surely a good thing? Giving more challenging work to high achievers can be done within an ability grouping, forcing teachers not to teach to the middle by having mixed ability groups seems the wrong way to go about fixing such problems._x0007__x0007_Is this not a problem about management of sets?

It is up to us to teach others in our building about how we should have heterogenous groups, not just in math but in all subjects. Teaching to strategies is helpful, meeting with individuals or small groups based on a strategy that they all need to work on. One way students can learn is though peer group work of the sort that we have seen in this course.

My children have gone through public high school and the math I have seen there is the most boring stuff I have ever seen.

Our 'auditors' are only interested in the measurable. I believe this comes about because the amount of progress that is genuinely measurable in a 30 minute observation session is so small that these people cannot determine whether real learning is actually taking place. They know nothing about individual students, where they started at the beginning of the lesson or where they could or should be at the end of the lesson. Consequently they invent a series of parameters which they find easy to measure and comment upon but which often have little or no importance in the learning of mathematics. So we teachers bend over backwards trying to satisfy a bunch of criteria that keeps our departments and schools out of the \\Requires Improvement\\\" category but which, in fact, contribute to the very problem this course is trying to address.

And to really push this philosophy in your classroom. _x0007__x0007_As a tutor, I get frustrated because so many students come to me saying that their teacher forces them to squash all of their maths onto one line on the page, or to rule a line down the page and squash as many questions onto one page, meaning they have no room to actually explain their steps (which is what I ask them to do, and their teachers never seem to ask them to do). The students I see are never asked conceptual problems, only the basic \\solve this, and this and this\\\". _x0007__x0007_If they are asked to explain their steps and asked to explain in their own words how something works, if you ask questions like these, it won't matter what the teaching philosophy of the tutor is, the students will still have to get used to explaining what they are doing and how it works. Yes some tutors and parents may just give the student the answer, but the student will likely learn more from answering (or having answered) questions about how and why something works than they would from the old \\\"solve for x over and over and over again\\\" routine (of course this still has its place, they need practice actually using and doing maths). _x0007__x0007_It is easy to blame the parents and tutors, but if you don't ask the conceptual questions, then parents and tutors are going to simply show the child how to apply a rule._x0007__x0007_Cheers, <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

With A/B partners I have the As explain something to the Bs, or the B's, to the As, and then often times the table group will then discuss as a group comparing their solutions and discussing things.  I've found that by having flexible groups, students don't feel like they are being pigeon holed into a particular group.  I've also found that sometimes students surprise me because they may work really well with a particular partner and they both really bring out the best thinking in one another.  Also, it allows students to work with different types of personalities, which is also a good life skill.  Therefore, I think grouping should be flexible and change often."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

For example, If I start with a piece of wood that is 12 inches long, how many 2-inch pieces can I get out of it? Answer: 6 pieces of wood, each 2-inches long. That's the same as 1 divided by 1/6.

The very notion that the class was able to generate so many different ways of visualizing how to count to ten was rather profound to me. I was simultaneously seeing 3+3+2+2 as well as 3+3+4 (the square). I don't think I would ever have counted on the diagonal. I believe the benefit of this class discussion is it opens up alternative viewpoints for students to discuss. As a lover of math and numbers, I always appreciate learning new ways to deconstruct and reconstruct patterns, and this helped me grow (at least a little). I think the benefits of this are subtle but far reaching for the students. Unfortunately for all my love for it, I wonder how incredibly boring it could be to many students.

The first was at the end, her example included the foot length of wood. First wood is not something's kids are used to using, next why was another measurement format (foot) added in to something that only increased confusion. If there was clear and immediate understanding of the initial concept using a foot may have been okay to extend the proof as one student did (but for most I think it just confused them).  I am sorry. But this was a very confusing math session to me. Perhaps the strategy of allowing students to think and respond seemed appropriate but this class needed more scaffolding. Some students almost got to the correct answer or proof but then did not fully understand what they had done. As when the one boy found out that there was 1 section of a2/3 piece with 1/3 left over    - he knew that 1/3 was 1/2 of 2/3 but did not realize he had the proof and went on to make a mistake by mult 2/3 by 1/2 he should have said I had one section of 2/3 and 1/2 of a section of 2/3 so in total I have 1 and 1/2 sections. The teacher 's example of removing 2/3 from the foot of wood made no sense as. The way she did it seemed as if she was subtracting the 2/3 not making groups of 2/3 she should have had two equal pieces of wood (again I do not like wood) then shown I need to make groups of 2/3. Then taken the 2/3 off, shown that she could get one group of 2/3 on the other piece of wood and shown she had some left over. The left over piece was 1/2 the size of the 2/3 chunk then she could have shown she had one group of 2/3 and 1/2 group of 2/3. Sorry but I did not like the content of this example at all. This was poor math to me except for one or two kids who got it ( the boy sitting down in black I think). I truly think this was a failure. sorry I know I am not an expert as you people are. But I really did not like this at all."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

That was a mistake. I taught over his head all year, and didn't even challenge the top 10% either.  My principal did not believe in prerequisites, so I had a student in in my class for basic math and again for physics in the same year.  His mom asked me why he was not doing well in either one.  It seemed obvious to me that the lack of success in physics was because of his lack of preparation in math skills.  His attendance was the issue in basic math.  But now I have somewhat of a differentiated system in physics, so I can let student move on without running over others, so I am in a better situation to handle a wider range of students in a single setting."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Respond with only one of the options shown and label the following text: This video and my own research reveals that many people, especially females, disengage with geometry in high school. Their achievement in mathematics spirals downward at that point and stretches to the future.  It makes me think that geometry is really poorly taught in high schools.  It should be more visual and less abstract than pure numbers, but I know many students feel that they are unable to do proofs.  I don't think presenting geometry in real world problems is the only strategy; however, that could be involved one per week or once per unit.  I think that students have to work more slowly with the concepts, using concrete objects, technology simulations, etc. until they have an intuition about it.  I hypothesize that males have a slight advantage in geometry because in our culture they are more apt to work with models, moving toys, tools, and even sports, which have geometric underpinnings.  Perhaps providing connections of geometry to art, photography, room and house design would broaden the real world examples.  And adopt a master learning sequence; if students don't get it, they get lots of opportunities to learn."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Unfortunately our school's tracking system tracks students right out of the classroom environment.

You can see it from the link below:_x0007__x0007_http://commonmaths.weebly.com/stanford-university1.html_x0007__x0007_Finally I will tell to my students that all can learn maths no matter they like them or not.

I have seen too many \\disabled\\\" students become complacent about their weaknesses because of this. Instead of telling a student that she can learn to read faster, listen better, focus longer, etc, they label it a disability and the only help that student receives is extra time taking tests--in a private room where other students rustling papers and tapping pencils can't disturb their concentration, and, worse than anything, sympathy grades from their professors. I've seen students who can hardly connect two related ideas trying to pass advanced college composition. These same students struggle with math--and most other subjects--because there is no  one telling them that they can overcome their \\\"disability.\\\" It's so refreshing to know this research has been done.

I pull lots on more in depth work from math meet questions, mensa puzzlers, and set students up with alternative packets and math texts. Personally I like the way Saxon Math works for kids working independently at times.  The deal I have with my students that are more advanced is that they join in on discussions and group work where I feel they will be able to provide alternate ways of approaching a problem. Another thing I sometimes do is pullout math units that never get taught in depth - probability, geometry etc. I also use Ed Zaccaro's Challenge Math and REal Life Problem Solving books - he has them for primary, intermediate, middle school and high school.

I tell students on the first day of every class that if I catch them saying something negative, they will have to stand in front of the class and say the opposite; then they can get a piece of candy.

The students then start trying to catch each other and having fun with that.

If he would have remained in our local public school he would very likely have been placed in a track lower than his actual math reasoning ability (<nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> because of speed).  He re-entered public school once he mastered basic math and was ready to begin algebra.  He has now been in public school for 2+ years, has received top grades in algebra and honors geometry and is starting honors algebra 2/Trig.  And, he loves math.  I would very much like to talk to the superintendent and/or principal about their reasons for using a track based system and to share the studies presented in this course as well as our personal example, but I, like you, think I might encounter push back.

Perhaps career planning should be the overriding consideration. _x0007__x0007_If a student finds later on after graduation that he wants to change from one to the other track, he can attend his local community college to affect the change._x0007__x0007_I grew up in the 50's when tracking started in high school.  At that point, you decided whether to prepare for college or prepare for a trade.  This didn't have the pejorative connotation that tracking does nowadays.  Sure, the kids heading to college were considered smarter and were always voted leaders.  However, we all knew full well that electricians, automotive mechanics, and plumbers could earn a good living, often better than our teachers. _x0007__x0007_I do buy into the growth mindset teaching approach. I agree that more students learn better with it and that it makes a difference when you get into the work force. Can't this methodology be used just as successfully in the trades as in math? I don't see that tracking precludes using it._x0007__x0007_I'm teaching at a community college.  Our placement exams aren't exactly the same as tracking.  The exams test where the students are now.  They don't predict where they _x0007_are going.  The exams don't prevent our students from reaching any particular goal.  Our classes are mixed with vast extremes of current ability.  So I don't have experience in teaching under the tracking method."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

My district adopted a curriculum for this course, but honestly with this group of kids who have never been pushed it was not good.

One is the power of having different sets of numbers that push on the same ideas that you want students to explore. So for example, if you are a second grade teacher and you are helping students think about subtraction, or difference, you might ask children to consider the same situation but with different numbers: for example, in one class students were asked to measure two different objects, determine which was longer, and then to figure out how much longer the longer object was than the shorter._x0007__x0007_Children chose the objects to measure, but the teacher was able to support students who were struggling by asking them to first find the difference between two objects close in size. On the other hand, those who quickly found the difference in length between two items were challenged to find the difference between two objects which varied greatly in length._x0007__x0007_In the end, the teacher had the whole class work together in groups to determine the way in which the difference in length between two objects she held in her hands could be determined. This was connected with the position of the numbers on the number line._x0007__x0007_So, the numbers and situations were different and appropriate for different students, but the conversation around the meaning of difference, its relationship to the relative position of numbers on the number line,  and how to determine what the difference is,  was held with everyone._x0007__x0007_In another class, the teacher routinely posted different sets of numbers for problem solving and students chose those which were an appropriate challenge for them._x0007__x0007_The second thing I want to discuss is my opposition to pairing children who are at very different places in their mathematical understanding. Except in cases where the two children have worked out a way so that both profit from the arrangement (and I have seen this happen in classes where repeated conversations around the question \\what makes a good mathematics partnership\\\" and then trying out different partnerships to see how they worked, was an important part of the life of the classroom) neither partner is helped by what often happens - one student does the work and \\\"explains\\\" it to the other, who readily agrees that s/he understands._x0007__x0007_The third thing I want to raise is the reality that some children need special support to focus and make sense of mathematics.

Respond with only one of the options shown and label the following text: The current focus in our district/school is on explicit direct instruction, for which one stated goal is all students taught grade level standards every day. In practice that often means we spend a lot of time teaching to the middle/low performers. The students who understand concepts are either given independent work or sit through the lesson. Regardless, they get very little of the teacher's time. That's a long way of saying that I do understand the argument that grouping can be a good way to target instruction to a child's readiness. Another model we use at our school involves regrouping students in a grade level for reading instruction. This looks like a classic tracking system. We do our best to be flexible with groups and regroup as often as we can, based on performance, but the reality is once in a group, it is difficult to move up. I've heard and read about many practices for mixed ability grouping. It is frustrating be limited in our ability to use them because they take longer than traditional teaching, in my experience, and at least in the short term. It may be true that that in the long term, you save or come out even on time, but I've found administration is not often willing to experiment with it long enough to reap the benefits. It's not just the administration's fault though. High stakes testing is really behind much of the current state of affairs. I'm eager to delve into the common core standards.

Also teachers should be brought their attention frequently to praise the achievement or the effort for the students not the students themselves by the principles or the advisors in the schools. Additionally, focusing on the growth mindset by including stories that emphasize students work and efforts from different countries and how great the results are,  would be another way to change teachers' thought in teaching math for our students regardless of fixed mindset.

Respond with only one of the options shown and label the following text: I've taught at several schools over the course of my career.  Most recently I've been in a school that tracks for math, language arts, and social studies.  When I first came to the school I convinced the math department to reduce the number of tracks but ultimately lost that battle and they went up to five tracks per grade in middle school.  Perhaps trying to mask the lowest group, it's called 'enrichment' rather than 'remediation'.  I had previously taught at a school that had multi-age grouping in which students were grouped by ability for some units (like procedural content) but were mixed 'ability' for others such as geometry.  I use 'ability' in the quotes to emphasize that I really think it was still confusing ability and performance.  That meant that students were re-evaluated at each unit which did result in some mixing and less clear identification of the low v high group.  I understand why the tracking occurs; people think it serves the students because the high achievers can fly without encumbrance and the low achievers can get the attention they need.  It is also hard to teach students at many different levels, especially with classes of 30 - 40 students for 46 minute periods.  On the other hand, it is just an illusion that students who are ability grouped are all at the same level.  It kind of gives the teacher the excuse not to individualize the instruction.  There is also tremendous pressure from parents of higher achieving kids to separate their children from the pack.  I've felt that this grouping does not help students, and I appreciate the specific research you've cited that I can use as evidence to support my own experience."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

He tells me he can't learn. But I have found out, by speaking to him in his language, that while he has had only one week of formal schooling (**one week, he repeats**) in his native language, Spanish, he managed to teach himself to read in Spanish. He does not read English because he is confused by seeing vowels which are pronounced so differently in English. He wouldn't even attempt to read a word that is a cognate of a Spanish word, because he thinks it must be pronounced differently (ex. guitar). I am slowly getting him to guess at how English words are read by making him read the consonants the way he would read them in Spanish. He clearly has a disability.

I added up the three variables to get the totals and saw that A being 2 is the only way to get a total of 14 rocks. Solution 3) A = x; B = x + 2; C = 4X. So 14 = x + x + 2 + 4x.

So, I have no experience what it feels like to be in either track.

They loose confidence in their ability and they think they are not smart and that those who are in advanced classes are the smart ones. It is self-fulfilling prophecy, even if they are the brightest, unfortunately, they believe they aren't and they become what they believe. There is a wide academic gap between the two groups at the 7th or 8th grade levels, as I see it in my school. All students get promoted to the next level regardless whether they learned the maths or not, as a result the academic gap gets wider and wider as students move on from k1 to 8th grade. _x0007_Doing this course was a great advantage to me.

Many of them are willing to take the Support Class because they want the extra assistance, but it is a subtle acknowledgement that they aren't \\smart.\\\" _x0007__x0007_When you pre-teach the material, you're decreasing the cognitive load that the students will go through on the day of class. Instead of \\\"Factoring?!? What does that word mean?\\\", they've practiced the word in resource class, and perhaps did some 4th-grade multiplication/factorization review and started the basics. Now, when they're in a group with high and low kids, the kids from the Support class have background knowledge to contribute. They're smart! They also will be able to follow along better with the lectured that's designed for-the-middle, because the very basics were covered the day before in Support class. And, the kids who traditionally get rewarded for having the background knowledge (the hand-raising volunteer types) have to step up their game because they suddenly have a lot more competition for teacher's pet. _x0007__x0007_I don't remember what study it was that showed this effect, but it's definitely something to look into. It makes much better use of time than having a kid sit lost and confused through the difficult material, and then handing them easier work the next day in Support class. It sends mixed messages as to what rigor level is expected, and it can mean that the main math class was a waste because the kid didn't feel comfortable with the word Factorization and thus 90 minutes of material went over his head. I also have seen the Support classes can turn into hand-holding classes where the steps are more and more broken down by the teacher who is \\\"assisting\\\" the student, whereas when the material is being pre-taught, the goal of the Support class is about growing your background knowledge on a topic up to a comfortable level, and it's becomes a safe place for asking questions you don't know, which will be helpful when you learn them \\\"for real\\\" tomorrow. _x0007__x0007_Anyway, best of luck - hope this helped!\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

I was so inspired by your curriculum and philosophy that I read your book, What Does Math Have To Do With It?,_x0007_as well as Mindset, by Carol Dweck. Although I tended to teach very much in line with your approach, this course reinforced and put science behind those ideas._x0007__x0007_So now my question and, somewhat, conflict. I do believe students need to learn the basics (facts) in conjunction with exposure to the more critical thinking skills.  I understand the importance of making it relevant and meaningful, and most importantly, being sure there is understanding of the concepts. However, with those other skills in place, do you agree that fundamental facts are important to master in the lower grades? To have these at your \\fingertips\\\" certainly helps when doing higher level skills._x0007__x0007_Also, do you believe that some people are born with an innate ability in math?  This isn't to say that most students with good instruction cannot become quite proficient in high level math, much more so than presently.  However, it does seem that from the start, some people take to the subject easier, quicker, and with deeper understanding than others._x0007_This is not unlike most talents.  Some people have a propensity for music or art or athletics or writing.  Again, I do believe that with excellent teachers, most students can excel as well, but there does seem to be some that are more gifted. _x0007_What do you think?_x0007__x0007_Thanks again for a wonderful course.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Respond with only one of the options shown and label the following text: Our school first assigns students in classes with SPED and gifted together (because they get extra support/time away from the homeroom) and then fill in slots to form their version of heterogeneous classes of about 32 students.  Our administrators do not believe in retaining students so at the fourth grade level you receive students that read first grade thru seventh grade level.  So we have such a broad range with some students that can't read/comprehend questions while others breeze through everything.  We are made to teach in timed blocks...1 1/2 hr. reading, 1 hr. math, 40 mins. for SS, 40 mins. for Science, and 30 mins. for writing.  We receive negative comments on evals if we go over 5 mins. We have an assistant occasionally (1/2 rdg, 1/2 hr math).  Teaching to the middle would leave the majority of the class lost or bored.  Trying to do guided math with 6 at a time is impossible with so many students and the limited time.  The past 2 years, the school's solution was to rotate and create homogeneous groups for math so that teaching to the middle would be more effective and as much intervention/guided math as possible would compliment.  My philosophy differs....Maybe we should not focus on grades (promote/retain) as much as on skill/concept achievement or have transitional classes.  The 'first grade level' students often become frustrated and become behavior problems because they need so many learning experiences and there is not adequate time due to pacing and benchmark testing.   I think we need more instructional support/smaller class sizes and they should be heterogeneous.  The jump that doubles the class size and 75% of the students did not master third grade is tough!

I was 13 years old and essentially gave up on learning math.

I went through three semesters of remedial maths and earned solid \\A's\\\" as well as became a developing maths tutor for my fellow students.

In soccer, the coach is constantly giving very specific feedback with a clear goal in mind. Also related, is the idea of giving reflections to students of the progress being made. It is challenging to take the time to reflect and then articulate the progress in a meaningful way. I am excited by this idea of challenge being the new comfort zone. Just like in my soccer analogy, why be a safe, mediocre player, when you can challenge yourself to rise to new level?

I have a lot of prepping to do to place students together to optimize the growth mindset.  _x0007_   I think sometimes teachers feel that ability grouping is an easier way to teach, and that may seem to be since mixed-group teaching really requires a lot of thinking and preparing to orchestrate a lesson where all students are challenged to think and understand.

Respond with only one of the options shown and label the following text: The principle reason for these negative messages is that Math actually is hard. It is one of those areas where students have to put in true pencil effort to learn. It is never enough to simply go to class and listen. The brain that flourishes in a course like Literature or History is used to remembering everything it hears and processing it immediately. With a well-developed auditory memory, this type of learning occurs without the student's awareness. While reading is necessary (although I remember attending a Masters seminar on Proust in which one of my classmates delighted in making contributions that superficially appeared to be based on his perusal of the material when in fact he rarely kept up with the assigned reading) most readers do not think of reading as an effort. But math requires actual effort. If at first you do not succeed, you must try again, rewrite the problem, learn to sleep on it, learn to push yourself to do what you do not find easy. Math is the vegetable portion of school offerings. It is good for you but you must 'develop a taste for it.'_x0007__x0007_Naturally, many adults  including parents and even educators persist in propagating a set of negative messages. Some parents complain that they have never 'used it' after completing school. One principal memorably informed me that our mutual student should not be concerned if she were unable to do the same math as her classmates since there are CEO's who cannot spell or do math. The implicit message was that our friend would be successful even though she would never 'get it'. _x0007__x0007_A current problem is that in this province at least, several factors combine to make math harder than in the past. The curriculum was prepared with the notion that calculators must be involved since they exist. Add to that the low esteem in which memorization is held and you have an activity based exposure to math concepts, many math concepts and insufficient practice so that no mastery results. Middle school students start to struggle the moment operations on fractions require them to find common factors. No times tables means no number sense. Often their teachers bow to time pressures and provide them with copies of the times table instead of encouraging them to skip count or write the multiples out. So another opportunity to 'get it' is sabotaged._x0007__x0007_Many people are rightly concerned that high school teachers should have completed a higher level of math in order to teach math (and I am surprised at the number of Phys Ed m"}], "max_tokens": 3}}

We had been talking about the concept of flexibility, being able to answer a question more than one way, and she had decided to try it in class by showing how to find the tip (15%) on a dinner two different ways.  Well, when she tried it the second way she got a different answer than she did doing it the first way and I thought to my self, GREAT! a chance to really look at what we mean by percents, the process, and how to deal with uncertainty.  Instead, to my dismay, she looked out at the class and said 'Oh, well I never was very good at math' and just skipped on to the next topic!  Another classroom of kids, and especially the girls, getting the message that math is hard to understand and it is ok to not be good at it."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Respond with only one of the options shown and label the following text: As a student I always felt grouping was a form of labelling and creating a caste system within a classroom. YEs I was the highest reader but that label set me up as an outcast with my peers so I tried to appear less interested in reading and to answer less of the reading comprehension questions correctly in the SRA reading system, simply to fit in. I believe students desire to fit in first to feel safe in order to feel accepted and then and only then are they free to focus on learning. In maths I was in the lowest grouping because I had missed basics being prematurely promoted to 6th grade in Canada (mislabeled) as I immigrated from England and the education systems when compared by my teachers in Canada appeared to be ahead in England. My language and literacy scores supported this theory however had I been properly and fully assessed in maths it would of been obvious that there were gaps and lags in basic skills for multiple reasons. Math phobia, I believed the girl messages about math and tuned math out more than I tuned in to cope with maths class. However I can see now and look back to see that without proper knowledge of my ability I was mis placed and a border casualty in being improperly grouped and placed. Both groups damaged me as a student. The system of teaching these subjects was also quite independent in both systems in the 70's and 80's many of my teachers sat behind desks while we worked quietly at our own desk. Discussion was not encouraged and a lot of the work, in literacy I found to be not challenging. Math's I found it to be too challenging and without support I gave up._x0007_As a teacher I place students in mixed ability Tribe groups for all subjects. Tribe leaders rotate and are not based on ability in the subject but on group communication leadership skills. there is a leader and a leader in training each week. All students have a voice in these learning groups and all questions, opinions and strategies are respected, explored and explained by members of the Tribe group. I have personally seen students with IEP's 2 grades below flourish and thrive beyond mine, their parents and their own expectations of their learning. They are supported, cheered and encouraged by their peers for the smallest of gains. this celebration of persisting at tasks is the focus not getting it right the first time. All students in the mixed ability groupings consider a variety of strategies and ways of knowing and this I believe is the key to strong students con"}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Additionally, students placed in a lower achieving group may develop a self-fulfilling prophecy that they are not as capable or intelligent because they have been placed in a particular group.

Respond with only one of the options shown and label the following text: I have so many questions about this topic. As an 8th grade math teacher, I teach two regular classes and one \\honors\\\" class of math.  I teach the same curriculum to all of the students but with the honors class, I can move more quickly or delve into topics a bit more deeply.  I have to slow down quite a bit in the other classes and review work such as how to work with fractions or how to find percent of a number.  These topics are not part of the 8th grade curriculum but many of the kids need a refresher on these topics as we explore functions.  In the honors class, most of the kids already have a solid foundations in these areas so this gives us a chance to explore something else.  We put as many kids as possible (32) into the honors class and definitely try to push kids into the honors group if they are borderline.  We use test scores and teacher recommendation to make the decision.  We are also careful that the demographics are representative of our population.  We  make sure to have the same high expectations for all of the classes.  Many of the students in my two regular classes end up improving their scores significantly by the end of 8th grade.  Some test out of algebra and end up taking geometry as 9th graders.  I treat all of my students the same, whether they are in the honors class or not.  In fact, they don't really even realize if they are in the honors class or not because we don't make a big deal out of it.  I am not a believer in tracking students--I believe that ability grouping should be fluid and that expectations should be high for all students.  I look at where students are at in the beginning of 8th grade and create my classes, and this does include an honors group.  _x0007__x0007_So, my main questions would be:_x0007_1.  Are Gifted and Talented education, Response to Instruction and Special Education considered to be tracking/ability grouping?  Does research show that these are ineffective?_x0007_2.  Would you put an 8th grader who has first grade math ability alongside an 8th grader who is ready for Calculus and expect to challenge both without frustrating them?  Is there a time when ability grouping makes sense based on widely varying abilities such as this?_x0007_3.  Is there a certain age when ability grouping does make sense? Perhaps it makes sense for 14 year olds but not 5 year olds?_x0007_4.  Do we define ability grouping as having groups of students that have certain prerequisite skills or are we looking more at an IQ test of sorts?\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

I can imagine it is hard to try to accommodate everyone's needs but I do think it can be done.  When my sons were in lower elementary school, their classes had stations or centers for both math and language arts.  I helped in the classroom and saw how the center offered a chance for each student to work at their own level on same or similar tasks.  In response to a prompt that often was built around the monthly theme of homes or gardens or the circus, etc., one student might have been using base 10 blocks to model a problem with adding tens and ones, while another used pencil and paper to add and carry 3-4 places, or another drew images showing addition, and so on. A parent helper or aide would be there to offer support and inspiration. Or sometimes it was set up so that one station had similar but more complicated tasks, the next had easier concepts or tasks, and the third, a simpler task yet, and the student could choose the task that was at their level.  This worked well and instead of grades, the school used a rubric for evaluation.  But I also recently watched my husband try the function task Jo gave us with the block towers and I thought he wouldn't be able to figure it out (I had found 4 different ways to look at the function) but he surprised me with a very different way of looking at the problem and I could see that his math esteem had grown when I told him that! I wish he had had a teacher who could have worked with him in his best way of learning or that he could have worked in a center-based math class with manipulatives.  Anyway, I like the idea of the growth mindset classroom, as it allows many more children the opportunity to be part of the learning community with their classmates and offers collaboration and problem-solving practice for higher level thinking and tasks."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Students too often are being spoon-fed information and just filling in answers.  Students will now be required to process large amounts of information and apply various procedures and operations and then interpret the results to derive an answer._x0007__x0007_Another idea that struck me was the quote by the columnist, \\...invention and discovery_x0007_emanate from the ability to try seemingly wild possibilities.

I think sincere thanks should be conveyed from all of us on the course to Cathy as this is an incredibly difficult concept to get across if prior teaching has not led to a solid understanding of exactly what division means. And this, I fear, is what the underlying problem is with these students. We have \\thinkers\\\", such as Sam and \\\"methodologists\\\" in this classroom. Sam has some great ideas and describes these with excellent graphics on the board. I truly believe the lesson could have been moved forward if the students had been asked to write down an example of a division that they did know the answer to and to then explain how they know their answer is correct. Students should then be asked to use this knowledge about 'simpler' division to help solve the 'harder' problem (i.e. the focus of this lesson). This is not the place to develop the lesson further but if students cannot use their prior knowledge of 'easier' division then they have to be told to look for an alternate 'reason' for their 'easy' division answer being correct._x0007_Once some understanding is gained the next step should be to start recording answers on the board and looking for patterns in the answers and from this, if sensible, a method developed... by the students._x0007_And here is where the real detailed lesson planning becomes important because it is these follow up questions that have to be accessible and useful in finding patterns that lead to a method. Which of these two would Sam find easier..._x0007_(A) One divided by three fifths_x0007_(B) One divided by three quarters. ?_x0007_Sam's next question is massively important to developing his understanding and must draw on his strengths before introducing yet another complex element of division.

I had one student this year who at the beginning of the year at a meeting with their parents was told that she has never been good at math and that it just was not her thing.  I feel like her identity and self worth is at risk when we feed into these stereotypes.  The experiences and comments both external and internal that are received from self, parents, teachers and society play such a large role in how we view ourselves and success.  As parents and teachers it is up to us to create experiences so that students can walk with a sense of self and not pigeon holding them into some predestined stereotype.  As a society we tend to buy into these roles, a mother once said to me in larger parent setting after being given a sample problem \\Oh I am just not good at math.\\\"  With that kind of mindset and bias, it reduce the chance of her child possibly being successful in math.  _x0007__x0007_The second observation is one of a more institutional bias that occurs with gender. I went to Georgia Tech (an engineering university) and the ratio of male:female was approximately 4:1. I believe this ratio to be indicative of a system that shows favoritism towards boys early and not towards girls when it comes to math and science. As children coming into this world, we are all born as natural inquirers.    _x0007__x0007_My mind map can be found at: http://www.text2mindmap.com/Nmi7jz.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

They had round the clock tutors who would sit with you one-on-one and help you.  Of course they had to help other students and some days it was busier than others and you didn't get alot of help.  It was staffed with tutors and teachers there would come to lend a hand with any student who needed help. But that math lab really helped me.  It was strictly volunteer for those students needing extra help and it was free for students.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  As a result of going to the math lab whenever I got stuck or needed one-on-on help I made an A in the course.  That would be good to have math and and reading and writing labs open in the schools for students to have acess to for any help.  I never felt stupid for going and it was open to anyone.  I think it is a wonderful thing to have in colleges and wish it could be applied to K-12 schools.

Once all 5 problems are worked out on the board, I discuss with the class the work and ask them to find where the mistakes are (either deliberate, or accidental). _x0007__x0007_One other mini-lesson I may add to my curriculum is a weekly highlight of a mistake that led to something snazzy._x0007_http://science.discovery.com/famous-scientists-discoveries/10-accidental-inventions.htm_x0007__x0007_TL;DR: 1.

Over time, mistakes are benign.  Learning accelerates.  Anyway, I believe this information should be taught directly to young children - as well as educators. For the kids, it will encourage them to be motivated and to see mistakes as learning moments.  (As a juggler said, if you are not dropping, you are not learning to juggle.)

Students moved in and out depending if they had difficulty with the concept.  Even a student who was not struggling was put into the group for a brief time.  This child did not know it but they were being used to help teach the others.  This was a first grade setting.  I am not sure if it would work in a higher grade.  I start a new job on Monday teaching the advanced math group for fifth grade.  The other group is called on target.  It is allowing me to pace differently than the other teacher.  The group was not chosen by just one test and it's not all the students with the highest grades.  The teacher took into consideration their effort. We'll see how it goes.

We don't need to grind up children in learning factories called schools._x0007__x0007_The only way to really support true learning, and not just be coming up with more Skinner box reward systems to successfully get the children through this factory, is to make school optional.  If you get rid of the compulsory nature of school, it will transform itself into an institution that we can actually be proud of, like public libraries.  Imagine if you were force marched and sat down in a public library every day, and then told exactly what book you were supposed to read and have memorized and you will have a test on it tomorrow?  Would you still want to go to the library??  The beauty of the library is that is is a free resource, but no one is forced to use it.  You use it when you want to for your own purposes._x0007__x0007_To pretend that committees can decide for you what you need to know and what you need to learn at every moment of your day, plan away your days in 10 minute intervals, because crowd control is going to get pretty sticky really fast if you run out of things to do... Now you're seeing school as I see it.  And so \\untracking\\\" is such a small tip of the iceberg.  Most of the terrible messages our children are receiving about life and education are coming from school and school systems.  Let's dismantle tracking.  Let's dismantle assessment.  Let's dismantle the idea of a core curriculum.  Those things are touted for \\\"safety\\\", but there's nothing safe in handing over your children to an institution and expecting that monstrosity to raise them.  Let the children choose what they want to learn and be actually eager to learn._x0007__x0007_By all means, mix up the people taking different subjects.  Who says you can't be learning Statistics at age 7?  Or when you're 39?  It is a broad enough topic to have interesting information for people at any age.  When you mix up groups, the strong will help the weak in a learning environment.  It is normal to start at the bottom and work to the top.  You can do it at your own pace.  You can drop out and decide that you would rather learn about something else.  That is why people love games.  No one forces them to play, and people who have played the game longer will help you learn it.  You always start out a noob, and you just learn on\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

I wanted to help out and thought that it wouldn't be that difficult.  Well, I really messed it up!  I damaged the cabinet box that was already attached to the wall, which couldn't be removed and replaced without tearing out some of the tiles already installed on the backsplash.

I was excited by the idea of getting different harder work or going to a different classroom for part of the day but that never happened. Finally, in 6th grade I got to take classes that were typically for 7th graders in some areas and that helped me a lot. Lastly I'm not convinced that mixed grouping is necessarily the best. We keep trying all these things in schools and none of them are a magical solutions and you what there isn't a magical solution especially when many of the students come from homes that are not ideal, that are broken, that do not value education, they hear negative messages about school all over the place. This is a societal problem, schools are one piece of the puzzle, and in my opinion it's not so much the teachers teaching that needs to change but the societal views of school in general that need to change.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Are we saying that, if these students are grouped together, my former community college students would then be Ivy League bound?

I was troubled by the universally negative view of this child and was determined to give him a positive experience in a classroom. During the first week I called his mom. She picked up the phone and said, \\\"What has he done now?\\\" I told her how nice it was to have him in my class (I had made sure to make the call during the \\\"honeymoon\\\" period) and I gave specific examples of things he had done successfully in class and mentioned that I saw that he clearly had the potential to do well. I heard a huge sigh of relief. We talked about working together to make this year a good stepping off point for high school and that I wanted to try to channel his energy into being a leader. Throughout the year, I continued to reinforce my belief in his potential by identifying examples of clear mathematical thinking even when he might have made arithmetic errors. His mom and I spoke frequently and only one of those conversations had to be about \\\"problem\\\" behavior. This experience was not universal among his other teachers._x0007__x0007_I guess this is a kind of long winded way of giving an example of the positive impact of demonstrating true belief in a student's potential by looking past the \\\"bad kid\\\" stereotype with which he had always lived.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

I have seen a lot of the \\lower-level\\\" individuals, whether just coming from high school all the way to those that are just improving their skills in my math classes.  I taught Basic Math, Pre-Algebra and Intro to Algebra.  I spend about 45 minutes talking with the students, the first night of class, about what is it about math that they don't like/get.  I found out that it was all about the teacher.  If the teacher didn't encourage them to want to learn, try again when a mistake was made let alone explain why their answer was incorrect, the student just stop wanting/liking math.  In 2012, I had a student that I had for Pre-Algebra (7:20pm class) send me an email.  I sat at my desk and just cried because she thanked me for helping her understand math.  I had the students build a set of basic resources that they could use in any math class.  There is/was tracking at this particular school and she earned an A from me which meant that she could either take a 2-semester Algebra class or a 1 semester class.  She chose to take the 1 semester class.  She told me that she struggled to learn the material, made mistakes, learned from them and persisted through the class.  She told me that she earned an A in that class.  I was so happy to here this.  In my class you just didn't sit in class.  The students worked in groups, did work in class, got up and went to the board to show what they knew.  In doing these things, the students felt comfortable about making mistakes, asking for help (from their classmates rather than me).  _x0007__x0007_My suggestion to you would be:_x0007_1.  Stop and talk with the students to find out what you're fighting._x0007_2.  Ask what you can do to make this a little easier for them._x0007_3.

This fall, we are going to launch our New Normal secondary PD project with a talk that Jo has agreed to do around Growth Mindset. This talk will help to surface some of the underlying issues around equity, bias, and systemic issues that actually contribute to problems such as stereotyping. I also plan to use articles such as the de-tracking article Jo wrote to probe deeper into the underlying reasons why we as adults actually perpetuate these problems. No question people's beliefs are a part of what we must work on as a community. I think getting our principals on board is important. Some of our high school principals for example are taking courageous steps to make changes (e.g. honors option in heterogeneously grouped classes). Others continue to suggest they will lose kids if they de-track. I think structures like tracking actually inhibit our ability to erase these stereotypes and inequities so, I know in my work, these more deeply seeded issues are the ones our community is poised to address in the coming year and beyond."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Having spent an inordinate amount of time in arcades as a young child, I learned that 4 quarters makes a dollar very quickly.  So, when I saw this problem, I immediately took 29/4 and got 7 remainder 1, which means 700 with 1 quarter left over...725.  This process has similarities to i^29  = i and other situations where certain groupings reproduce patterns.  Another example is \\what is the last digit of 9^1000?\\\"  This problem produces an overflow error on most calculating devices, but we can solve by looking for a pattern within the last digit and then dividing the 1000 by the number of numbers in our pattern and applying the remainder.  _x0007_So, what I'm trying to say here is that I thought that putting Vivian's method in the category of the distributive property was nice, but the distributive property may not have been what she was really thinking.  She may have simply been grouping 4 quarters to make dollars.  While interpreting this in light of the distributive property is excellent, is it not also excellent to think of grouping the 29 into groups of 4 to make 100's with either 0, 25, 50, or 75 left over?  If we happened to be in the context of counting quarters, I would suggest that this is what we would have done...make stacks of 4 quarters until we used our quarters up then count the hundreds and than count the leftovers by 25 cents apiece.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

I will go over this with the students at the beginning of the year, but maybe first allow them to express what they like and dislike about learning and school. In general, I think starting the school year with a discussion rather than diagnostic testing and heaps of homework might help us all start on a positive note. I'm also hoping to find an exciting beginning of the year math activity that will grab the students' attention and make them eager to learn (I already have a science one).

Respond with only one of the options shown and label the following text: If I have to chose one of these reasons, I would say that a lot has to do with the teaching methods that are used by math faculty. Math faculty are typically folks who are good at math and may have difficulty working with students who don't immediately grasp these concepts. These faculty often teach math in the same way they learned it, which is a very rule/algorithm-based method, rather than experientially or contextually. However, the reason these students are in remedial math is because they didn't learn from these methods in the first place (in middle school and high school) so teaching this way in college is not going to help them any more so._x0007__x0007_However, I think another reason that isn't mentioned here has to do with non-cognitive and affective factors. Many students have an anxiety and fear about math, and come in to a math course believing it is difficult, which makes it harder to reach them and get them interested in math. I think this is a common attitude in American culture that \\math is hard\\\" and therefore it is something to be feared and something that it's okay to be bad at. For students who didn't have positive experiences with math at a young age, teachers are fighting against this kind of negative affect.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

When training a  neural network, there are 2 activities, creating new connections and reinforcing \\\"good\\\" existing connections.

Recall activity, if not conducive to growth, it may play a key role in this reinforcement portion and still be extremely important._x0007__x0007_Neural network learning curves are often modeled using a sigmoid function (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function), this describes the fact that initial learning is shallow, but after some reinforcement it gets to a point where the learning becomes much stronger very quickly (where the slope of the sigmoid becomes much steeper) and then it reaches saturation, where it takes a lot more effort to produce an improvement. _x0007__x0007_The key may be in finding the right balance between growth and reinforcement. If we focus too much on reinforcement (which may be a problem in the current education systems) then we reach saturation point and simply get diminishing returns.

There is no reason to think there would be a correlation between these two variables so they are removing the applied stream.  Most of the other boards in our province are watching to see the impact this can have.  I've often found it odd that our board does not stream students from kindergarten to grade 8 and then we do from grades 9 - 12, like there's some magic switch during the summer between grades 8 & 9 that goes off & allows 14 year olds to decide what path their life will take once they leave our system.

This lets the students know where their understanding of a topic is currently. Students can always retake any summative assessment but only the parts that they were below proficiency. I give them different questions  but first we have discussions about their current approaches and understanding._x0007__x0007_I believe the biggest message we can communicate is that everyone learns at different paces and in different ways.

When students make the first type of mistake, they can learn how to correct their conceptual or procedural bearings, or correct the simple mis-calculation.

We were then assigned extremely difficult problems for homework, and I struggled with them.  It was if I had no compass at all.

Respond with only one of the options shown and label the following text: In working with students on such problems I abandon the goal of representing the situation in one variable and let them use A, B, and C to start with. I don't see a need to use just one variable, and having 3 variables allows the students to keep the original problem in their head a little longer in working the problem. Jumping right to using 'x' to show the relationship between the three piles is too big a step.  So:  B = A + 2; C = 4A; A + B + C = 14.  Then I talk about the importance of the equals sign.  The equals sign is a like a balance scale.  The equals sign means you have the same amount of stuff on the left that you do on the right.  The equals sign means that the thing on the left (same amount of stuff as the right) can be substituted for the thing on the right anywhere it appears in this problem.  And vise versa -- the thing on the right can be substituted for the thing on the left anywhere it appears in the problem.  So in this case, you can substitute A + 2 for B anywhere it appears in this situation, and 4A for C anywhere it appears in this situation.  So A + B + C = 14 can become A + (A + 2) + (4A) = 14.  I will actually write out A + B + C = 14 with lots of space, and then erase the B and write \\(A + 2)\\\" in its place; erase C and write \\\"(4A)\\\" in its place.  At this point I will point out we now have a mathematical representation of the problem of piles of rocks and how many is in each pile.  We check that this mathematical representation truly does represent the problem.  Then I ask them for a leap of faith -- to not think about the original problem, but just look at the equation.  Now there is one variable in the equation and let's find out what it is -- view it as a puzzle.  I let them do any manipulation they want to as long as that manipulation honors the equals sign.  We look at the result of each manipulation, asking does it make the equation look less complex -- always keeping in mind that at this point, the goal is to get to \\\"A = ...\\\" -- finding out what A is.  Once we have A, I have the student look back at the original problem and tell me what we've found out.  I ask have we answered the question originally asked?  If a single variable, such as x is used, it is easy to think the problem is solved once we find x.  But by using A, and looking back at the original problem, we find that we know A, but there is still more work to do to find B and C.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

For the second (card) problem, I'm not sure how we got an arbitrary 4 and 6 cards for the visual representation.  The way I solved the card problem was to look at the ratio of 2 : 3, then realize that the two cards compared to the three cards represented ONE more card; therefore, to have FOUR more cards, both sides of the ratio must be multiplied by 4.  (Hence, the 8 : 12 ratio)  If Tesha had 12, then Holly had to have half as many, or 6._x0007__x0007_I figured out the painting problem exactly the way Jo describe, with one HUGE exception - I'm not sure how she decided to multiply both sides by 15/8.  This could be seen as very confusing to the students.  Once I realized 8/15 of the house was painted in one hour - and knowing that 8/15 represents just over 1/2 of the entire house - I realized that it would take just shy of two hours to accomplish the entire painting job.  I took the number 1 (representing the one house), then divided it by 8/15 (representing how much of the house would be finished in one hour) to figure out how much time it would take to complete the job.  Dividing 8/15 is the same as multiplying by 15/8, which means it would take 1 7/8 hours to complete the job."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Taking piano lessons as a child I certainly had to learn the scales and practice, though I could have and probably did play randomly/creatively on my own.   The description of obtaining the formula for area of a triangle is also good, but first you really have to understand the meaning of rectangles (versus any other quadrilateral), the concepts of parallel and perpendicular lines, and even the concept of area.  Those things don't arise out of vacuum and it's not feasible or possible to recreate all of math on one's own.

We are all about \\\"spirally\\\" with the expected outcome being mastery of each skill.  What ends up happening is that we keep throwing concepts and processes at students as they progress through the grade levels without giving them the needed and necessary time (one size fits all pacing guides) to obtain a true understanding of what's being taught. As teachers we are asked to take courses about number and number sense, but aren't given the time to implement what we've learned. My state is one of the few states in the U.S. that hasn't subscribed to the Common Core standards which seem to be more developmentally appropriate for students.

The lighthouse group is for students who would like to have her check in briefly and less often. The sailing group is for students who feel confident to work on their own.

This was a class of 'foundation' students.  Students whose highest expected level of achievement at GCSE would be a grade C.  Half of these students were expected to fail to achieve grade C (and did).  Most of these students wanted to achieve this magical grade C because it would open doors for them in the world of college and careers._x0007__x0007_All of these students had experienced repeated failure in maths mostly throughout their time in school.  Some were willing to work hard to achieve their grade (and did).  _x0007__x0007_The key thing I recall though is that NONE of these students enjoyed maths.  The carrot at the end of the stick that helped them maintain their efforts in class (and at home in prep for their exam) was that once they had bagged their grade C they would never have to do maths again!  As teachers we even used this carrot with flagging students \\Come on, you might as well do the work now otherwise you will end up doing maths again in college!\\\"_x0007__x0007_It won't be too many years before these students turn into the kinds of parents we are talking about.  As  I see it today, the whole purpose of maths education in English schools is to achieve at least a grade C at GCSE.  The whole purpose of maths GCSE grades is to divide society.  Why then should students who can see that they have struggled or failed to make the grade be positive about maths when bringing up their own children?  Without intervention the best we can hope for is that these students will go on to encourage their children to work hard at something that is not enjoyable in order to achieve a good grade.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Some students are tracked early into Algebra I and Geometry so there are various levels of those. Algebra I has the most tracking (some start in 7th, some in 8th in parts, some in one semester in 9th, some in two semesters in 9th, and some in three semesters in 9th/10th). This class is the most failed class in 9th grade and has the worst of all our math classes on the end-of-course state exam scores despite (or maybe in spite of) how much the school has tried to \\individualize\\\" the pace of it. I think it's exactly what you're saying though that because these kids are in what they know is a slow-paced class with other slow-paced kids they're not excited about it and there is no one there (students or teachers) to challenge them and encourage them to work at higher levels. [As a similar side note, Geometry was the next most \\\"tracked\\\" class with the options of Geometry or Honors Geometry in one semester or Geometry in 2 semesters (which was really only weeding out the top 10% and the bottom 5% from the regular classes). Geometry scores are the next lowest math scores in the building.]_x0007__x0007_On the flip side, Algebra II (which I teach currently) has no tracking aside from the fact that it is not necessarily \\\"required\\\" for every student. Most students will take it and there are no levels of tracking to it so the very bright 9th graders are mixed in with the average 10th and 11th graders and the 12th graders who haven't seen math in over a year). It seems like a challenge but I love it because of the variety. I give challenging questions to all of them and am pleasantly surprised to see how many try the challenges no matter what level of skill they feel they have. The discussions are more interesting and useful with the variety of skills in the room and the test scores at the end of the year are the best in the department too. So I'm with you in thinking that tracking has a significant impact on the \\\"enjoyment\\\" and successfulness of the class for all students.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Teachers were told to get rid of other teaching materials.  I welcome a shift to common core and cooperation among students at a range of levels.  There were some very rigid and stressful things happening.  I am very much in favor of moving away from ability grouping at my grade level.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

First, there is an opportunity to see how different students in the class see the same arrangement differently, which can challenge everyone to try to see it the way another saw it. Students can develop new strategies by seeing what others have seen and done. It is also an opportunity to stretch the students to develop a mental image and hold that in their head rather than counting by ones. If they can see 4 as a square, then they can hold that in their minds and not have to count it, and when they see it again in another arrangement they can use it without counting.

It is important to ensure that mathematics is not singled out as different from learning anything else.  Mistakes are always an opportunity to learn.  It is interesting to me that so many processes people participate in are not considered mistakes.  Have you ever tried to load a car for a camping trip?  Items are placed in the compartment and them you find not everything will fit so you shift things around, finding better configurations of the items that will provide the necessary space.  Did you stop and get frustrated because you made a mistake, did you ever think of it as a mistake?  Each person faces the dilemma with a different set of skills and willingness to work through the problem.  Maybe you decide not to take all you had planned (I will survive without the air conditionera) or maybe you get creative and put some things on top of the car, maybe you just decide to rent a trailer, maybe you ask someone else to help you get everything in the car.  Once at this stage of camping, packing the car, very few people would give up and decide not to go.  It is common for the completion of  many tasks that adjustments be made.  No matter what you want to accomplish those that work through the issues will be more successful than those who give up at the first sign of trouble."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

My job is, in essence, to figure out what they naturally see and supplement it with the rest of the picture.

As Eric Wahl stated in Unthink Rediscover Your Creative Genius: _x0007_Our education taught us to memorize the predetermined answer or study the predetermined method in order to deliver the predetermined solution. There was nearly always one right way to one right answer, and an A+ job meant finding and following that path repeatedly.There was rarely if ever room for what we so fondly call thinking outside the box. You and I were rewarded for - often literally - making a check mark inside the right box. We were taught to be art critics but not artists. To think but not to unthink._x0007__x0007_We dont meet the students where they are at and build on each students genius. Because of this type of education students do lack foundational knowledge because they lose their curiosity and thrill of discovery. They arent exploring and encouraged to make mistakes, collaborate and innovate to truly understand the math concepts. They then have a  self image that they dont have ability, which is far from the truth. Depending on a students experience with Algebra it can seem very difficult in their eyes."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

When I was a sophomore taking Geometry, I struggled a great deal. I tried and tried and my teacher one day said to me, \\I know how hard you are trying and you aren't really getting it. I think you should drop Geometry and take typing.\\\" Sadly, I did follow her directions and to this day, I regret it. I currently am in a literacy coach capacity but work with students in grades K-5 for different academic areas. I do not want any student to ever get a response from a teacher like I got. I often wondered years later, \\\"Why didn't she tutor me after school or suggest that my parents get a tutor for me?\\\" I assumed she thought I would never \\\"get\\\" it, so what was the point? When I have taught math to students in second and third grade, I always wanted students to be able to explain their thinking and how they arrived at the answer they did even if it was incorrect. I think having students work in groups together is a powerful learning experience so each can share their thoughts. I also believe the teacher must be circulating through the classroom and listening to what students are saying. I also remembered that when I was in school, we \\\"had\\\" to memorize our times tables. To this day, I know them. Students today have difficulty memorizing them. For me, it was a drill and kill type learning. I have had students who have learned their times tables using songs and music. Others who write and write the times tables repeatedly do not have success memorizing. So I believe there is not one right way for each student to learn and we as teachers need to find the different avenues available for students and offer them different paths to achieve goals.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Respond with only one of the options shown and label the following text: I knew this topic would come up, and to be honest, I really wasn't looking forward to it.  Context: I teach in a very small school district where we typically have 30 to 40 students in a graduating class.  For students below middle school, there are typically two classes per grade level.  At middle school, they are typically divided into two groups per class level for math.  These are generally divided up into a lower and higher ability group, with the understanding that the higher level group is aiming to study Pre-Calculus by their 11th grade year._x0007__x0007_There have been two full time math teachers in our district for a long time, each of us having been here for about the same amount of time. Other teachers take a class or two from time to time. When we first arrived, students where grouped by ability, but an administrator thought it was a bad idea and changed it.  I didn't see much trouble with the new arrangement ... until my oldest child started into my classes. She, as a hard-working and inquisitive student, suffered terribly because she was constantly waiting for other students to catch up. The classic line I remember from 8th grade Math was (in December) \\Papa, I learned something NEW today in class!\\\"  We changed to ability grouping shortly after my colleague's son suffered the same fate in an Algebra class.  _x0007__x0007_Honestly, since behavior and effort affected the decision as much as ability, we changed it because we were tired of watching hard-working kids get held back by clowns.  I don't require cross country runners to train at the same pace for the same distances, and I don't feel good about doing the equivalent with my math students.  I do spend a lot of time encouraging both groups (remember that even within the groups there is a wide variety of performance because there are only two classes) to think and communicate carefully, to try new methods of solution, and to not limit themselves with their attitude about their ability ... be it positive or negative._x0007__x0007_We(my colleague and I) both recognize that we have growth opportunities when it comes to differentiating instruction for different ability levels within the same classroom.  We are concerned, though, that having too wide a gap between the ones who need the most help and instruction and those who can easily move ahead seems to be cheating both groups.  We were told that the top-level students would help their struggling peers so that both would grow.  It worked at times for the most polite of the hi\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

We departmentalize and I teach math. The high group, which was medium to high, was the most difficult. They were difficult to challenge. They just wanted what they were successful/comfortable with. The middle group turned out to be very socially challenged and difficult to teach at all. The Low to middle group included all students identified with learning disabilities as well as low/middle students. This group likely grew the most because the barriers of inferiority was eliminated. All of the students functioned like equals in the class and they worked well as teams. They accepted challenges and really rose above all expectations. None of the groups were \\\"tracked\\\"  or \\\"labeled\\\" but since we had to group them for rotations, I did love seeing what low performing students would do when they were not made to feel inferior.

After finishing 6th grade math, she passed all the requirement to skip 2 levels of math and take HS Algebra in 7th grade. I was not happy with her decision but she took it anyway. However, she had a terrible experience. She could get the concept but she was not fast enough to finish the exams with high scores. She could pass the course but she repeated to make sure she has a stronger foundation. The second time the class was so easy to her that she was complaining how boring it was and she got excellent results. In high school Math has always been her strongest subject and she mostly taught herself and often she was tutoring and helping her classmates. However, when I talk to her and ask her about her math classes she is always unhappy with her teachers as they only give them lots of busy work and it is not fun. She does not seem to enjoy the class at all. _x0007_As a future math teacher I really like to learn how I can show the fun of math to my students. I am not surprised by hearing that a lot of people are scared of math and/or not enjoying it.

They do credit the teacher and they think that what they have learned will carry over to fourth grade math, which is very forward-thinking for 3rd graders.

Educators have a tremendous impact on their students lives, and I cannot think of something more rewarding than knowing I impacted a childs life forever._x0007_ All students learn differently, therefore, answering the question, how do students learn? with one simple answer is close to impossible. A more accurate question is what teaching styles, techniques, or strategies are used in your classroom to promote high quality learning? Individuals learn at different speeds and are often times at various academic levels. With that said, we, as educators and student role models must seek out learning styles that click best with our students and their personalities. Once a teacher and student seek learning styles, techniques, and strategies that promotes positive, enjoyable learning is when I believe a student will learn at his/her best._x0007_In my future teaching career, I will discover such teaching styles that will enhance my students academic performances by planning several lessons that incorporate Howard Gardners multiple intelligences. For instance, I may give my students the option to work on a classroom assignment by themselves or with a partner, demonstrating Interpersonal/Intrapersonal intelligence. The assignment may consist of creating a drawing and then writing a short paragraph explaining their artwork, which is also incorporating Spatial and Linguistic Intelligence into the lesson. I will be teaching the primary grade levels, thus, one may not be completely aware of the learning style that is most beneficial to them. I, as an educator, will offer my students several options within my lessons. Therefore, they are able to develop the learning style that is most enjoyable to them, and I am able to notice which of the eight Howard Gardner intelligences they prefer. Once I notice what teaching styles engage my students learning, I will continue to use such techniques and strategies frequently throughout the course of the school year._x0007_Understanding your students learning styles and finding strategies that best fit your students is the framework to having a lively, but yet comfortable learning atmosphere.
