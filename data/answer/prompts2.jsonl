I'm a middle and high school teacher and I erroneously thought that students started to gain the \\can't do\\\" math around grade 5 or 6 - due to the fact that the material gets more abstract (this is where algebraic ideas generally begin in curricula). Boy was I in for a shock when I interviewed a 5-year old who said she was bad at math! FIVE?? With all I have learned this year, this isn't so surprising anymore, but is all the more disheartening. I believe that \\\"struggle\\\" - mentioned by <redacted> -  is something that needs to be seen in a more positive light - as PART of the learning process. So often teachers and parents are quick to \\\"rescue\\\" a child from a perceived struggle rather than allow students to let their intuition loose on a problem.

I now work at the middle level and I wonder when and why student enthusiasm about learning math seems to lessen or disappear.  Could this lack of excitement be about the tracking that happens at middle school?  Could it be that they aren't yet confident related to number sense and fluency and it isn't something we focus on at the middle level?  How can we keep students excited about learning math as they work at the middle level?  Maybe doing more with developing their number sense and fluency through the use of math talks could bring back their confidence and excitement?"}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Yet, here I am entering my 23rd year of teaching and teaching a Pre AP precalculus class.  Each year I present my students with a survey.  I have taught all levels of math.  The most prominent response that comes from my students is that they did not like or think they were good at math until they came to my class.  They may still not like math, but they are appreciative of it and took something with them.  That is a success in my book.  I don't believe that someone 'cannot' learn math."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

It also leads to far more interesting responses for assessment.   The challenge for the teacher is in coming up with substantive options that allow for different forms of expression while expecting learners to concentrate on the same learning goals. There is an art to differentiation, and it is an area for skill development and practice for every teacher. There are many ways to differentiate instruction and/or assignments.

I haven't met a student yet that is just completely incapable of learning math.

At some point they are able to show mastery on a skill or concept, but weeks or months down the road they cannot remember how do it now.  The inverse of this situation is also true, in that my brightest math students are the ones that can/do retain all their previous math learning and can recall it quickly with little reteaching._x0007__x0007_I believe that the reason for this is that students don't use the math, therefore it is not retained.

I would prefer to do an assessment that is both learning and showing how what the child knows.  The problem is that this hard to compare to everyone else and children are not consistent in their performance on any given day.  Also when children go home and can not do an assignment because of either the parent wants the child to do it one way or a child just wants to quickly finish the assignment so can not be bothered with taking the time to think as he might have done in school.  The reaction from a parent is often that the assignment is too hard or child never learned anything which means the assessment means nothing.

Respond with only one of the options shown and label the following text: I am not sure whether any setting can be justified, however there is a great deal of mileage in enabling students to aspire. As a head of mathematics at a secondary school in the UK I have often been asked how can we ensure we are adding value to each and every child, thereby enabling each child to fulfil their potential and grow as students of mathematics. I agree with many of Jo Boaler's sentiments especially giving students implicit fixed mindset messages regarding setting arrangements in schools, which has given me much food for thought. Setting does pose a number of issues, none more so than students being pigeonholed into a stereotype, as attainment within set 1 within one struggling school could be working at the same standard as a student within set 4 of a geographically and socio-economically different school considered outstanding. That said as a school that does set its students there are a range of supporting mechanisms that I think we use well, which can help alleviate some of the fixed mindset messages she talks about. One of the main ones involves team teaching opportunities which involves teaming up students within various groups to complete tasks, equally setting tasks across year groups and encouraging students to complete assignments collaboratively, with another students from another group. Equally i feel strongly that students can achieve a sense of achievement in the maths classroom by drawing on a variety of creative strands. Using cross curricular strands which celebrate other aspects of school life, and particular strengths of the students. These opportunities may draw upon skills that students may consider to be outside the normal parameters of the mathematics classroom. Also much of mathematical attainment is closely allied to motivation to learn. Some of those motivations can be intrinsic in nature. However it is my experience that students view a mathematics qualification as desirable as it enables them to access other qualifications and career paths. Mathematics therefore as a gatekeeper qualification is one of the necessary career related and dependent qualifications, therefore there can be some mileage in informing students of opportunities open to them and using that as a driver for performance, therefore taking away issues and comparisons with peer attainment."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

The students at each grade level are learning the same material, but at different paces. I want to expect the same end goal for each set, but take the expectation and spread it out over the time needed for each set of students to understand and make sense of the material on their own.

It is up to the teacher to recognize \\misplaced\\\" students and prepare materials on a few levels inside each grouping. It is very hard to do, no doubts. With our already super-busy overload, it is hard to find the time and energy to prepare multilevel lessons, however it is critical for student learning.

I have a student that scored incredibly low in another math class even though her understanding and thinking processes were incredibly advanced. It's extremely discouraging to be told that you're not good at something, especially when you are. Also there seems to be this notion floating around that if you get something wrong that you don't understand it. Getting something \\wrong\\\" is often a simple computation error that doesn't indicate whether or not the greater concept was understood. And getting something \\\"wrong\\\" just means that there is room for more exploration, not that something will never be understood.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

In Canada, high school we have three level of math class, Academic/University level, Applied/college level and basic/workplace.

Therefore a lot time in my grade 9/10 academic/university level course students only have grade 5/6 level of basic math skill. I find that it is very difficult for me to engage them, they feel bad and lost most of the time. I often to suggest them to take one level lower to start then later to come back to high level mat class. I am not sure if I am doing the right thing or there will have some other ways I can teach them better....Looking forward to hearing your thoughts._x0007__x0007_Regards,_x0007__x0007_<nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>"}], "max_tokens": 3}}

What about for big circles - can you measure something in order to get the circumference? We then did measurements of diameter and circumference to calculate our own version of Pi and the teacher wrote some on the blackboard to see if there was a consensus of numbers and that's where we came to learn that it was also a number that could never be pinned down to a simple number and needed a word.

The meeting that they had this past week was about using test data to group students on math abilities in order to really help those kids. These ability grouping sessions would take place for about an hour, 3 times a week. They emphasized that these groups would be flexible-- students will be able to move throughout the groups. Do you still think this kind of attention would be detrimental? I definitely understand that students may pick up on the groupings and feel the stigma of their group, but other than these three hours of the week, the students are constantly working in heterogeneous groups, which I agree is so beneficial.

Respond with only one of the options shown and label the following text: I do think the methods that are used to teach math are inadequate. I began teaching in 1993 and the curriculum used at first school I worked at was ARISE, a problem based math program that took big problems and expected kids to work in groups and solve things together. They would ponder and struggle and then the next lesson would give them help and clarification. It was a good first step, but it had problems--for a new teacher, it was hard to really know what my role was, how to lead and guide kids effectively. But it was real math (my BS was mechanical engineering, and though I always tested well in math, I never understood the point until we were required to model physical situations mathematically junior and senior year). Within 5 year, everything shifted in California. We left off any pretense of teaching kids to think and were expected to spend all our time showing kids procedures and trying to get them to memorize them. _x0007__x0007_I am getting long winded here, but what I am finding is that the kids in our district who are tracked into the lowest classes (yes, our district returned to tracking for a while) were kids who required meaning. At the end of the page? where the \\word\\\" problems are? With a group of low track kids, I could ask questions and they would figure it out. With the \\\"smart\\\" kids, they would say \\\"Just tell me the formula\\\" and get angry and frustrated when I tried to help them think about what was going on. _x0007__x0007_That being said, in our district, the desperate lack of basic skills really compounds the problem when I get them at the middle school level. But I think if we taught for meaning (and helped elementary school teachers understand what the point was in math and where math was leading in high school) we would have a much better result._x0007__x0007_So both a) and b)!

The same is true of my algebra classes. In these classes I have students who took algebra I in middle school, those who have had some algebra I and those who are extremely green. In the beginning of the course it is hard to keep the more advanced students motivated because the material is very knowledge oriented, but as you move on it is much easier to challenge each student according to their needs and abilities.

As a classroom community we talk throughout the year about learning from each other and how everyone has something to teach other students.  I hope these growth mindset messages help counteract the 1/3 of my class time were I am grouping students to provide extra support.

To register for each math class depends student & their parents, there is no qualification requested. Therefore a lot time in my grade 9/10 academic/university level course students only have grade 5/6 level of basic math skill. I find that it is very difficult for me to engage them, they feel bad and lost most of the time. I often to suggest them to take one level lower to start then later to come back to high level mat class. I am not sure if I am doing the right thing or there will have some other ways I can teach them better....Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

In the 20 years that I've taught math at grades 4-12, I've seen quite the correlation between number sense and understanding of the more advanced problems.

As a middle and high school math teacher, I've come to really appreciate the importance of my students' primary mathematics past.  _x0007__x0007_Just recently, I was working with a group of students in our summer program on this problem https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=<phoneRedac><zipRedac>1<zipRedac>22&set=a.<phoneRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><phoneRedac><phoneRedac><zipRedac>6151&type=1&theater .  The students were given an opportunity to try it on their own for <zipRedac> minutes, then partner up with a student or two for the next <zipRedac> minutes.  What I noticed during the partner/group time in many instances was the students with the stronger number sense skills not only approaching this problem differently, but in a more efficient way.

In fact, we have been talking about it in class a lot.  Well, I thought I was pretty clever and I gave them a challenge math problem the other day.  I was going over their papers and I realized I'd made a really bad mistake on the problem.  The problem had to do with trimming a tree.  In the problem, it said that every year my husband would trim the tree about 3 inches.  Then, I realized that I didn't say how much the tree would grow every year.  Well, these kids are so used to getting information and processing it without questions.  We've trained them to do that.  So I started to think that I need to make a big deal of this and show them my mistake with diagrams and see if they can figure out my mistake in writing this problem.  This got me to think about the video and how the math has to feel right to us and make sense.  It is scary that we no longer allow kids to trust in their math sense and visualize problems.  If we give them more opportunities to question and explore, hopefully we can get kids to wonder and try to make sense of the world instead of looking to a person or a book for the correct answer."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

It works, because rather than slowing the curriculum down, each year learns a specific area of it. So no one starts to learn how to solve simultaneous equations before Y10/ everyone starts at year 10. It also means higher achievers are not pushed as hard as in the UK system. Sure, they can become extra profficient at one area of the curriculum, but they are not shown more. _x0007__x0007_Overall, I would prefer classes not to be in \\\"tracks\\\", but you have to admit that if you have kids who still can't read at age 11, it's not that easy to accomodate them well with kids who have had all the opportunities they needed and who outperform the rest.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

I know when I first started teaching math a few years ago I definitely felt this need to step in and show the kids everything because I thought that is how it was done.  However, in the past year I have changed I give more open ended problems and I let the kids struggle with the math.  When they are stuck I will often asking probing questions.  I also have them working in groups so that they are sharing ideas.  I encourage them to share their ideas.  I also tend to have them write and reflect about the math as opposed to doing to many problems.   It is in these stuck situations where the learning takes place.  In reviewing the content of the problem, I will often times have students present their work as opposed to me doing the presenting.

This is so difficult and many students are already shut off from Maths with fixed mindsets that are incredibly hard to change when you have a curriculum to get through and a common test that you have to push towards doing by a certain date.  To some students you could teach fractions every lesson (a different way every lesson) and they still seem to forget it by next week.  _x0007_I agree with Miss <redacted> that we cannot change by continuing to teach the traditional way and you may lose your job in the process of trying to leave the traditional route or get parent complaints that you are not covering the same material as the other classes.  Many schools do not allow you to deviate from the traditional path.  All classes must get the same handouts etc.  I like your link to the book - it looks worthwhile investigating.

Respond with only one of the options shown and label the following text: In Spain we usually don't group students by their abilities and in fact I think that it is forbidden by our laws. However, there have been some approaches to grouping recently:_x0007__x0007_- In Maths, Spanish and English (the so-called 'instrumental' subjetcs), in some schools, three groups are made out of every two, grouping the students according to their level. The intention is having a lower amount of students in the \\low achievement group\\\" and then try to help them improve and catch the rest of their mates. This rarely happens. But teachers do say (I myself have never been assigned to such a group) that this grouping allows them to work with students who otherwise would be 'dead soldiers' in the classroom. I am talking about students who can't add or subtract, who can't name basic geometric figures and that, therefore, are unable to follow the path of a normal class. These students, as I say, do not usually catch up with the rest... but at least they are doing some work and avoiding illiteracy._x0007__x0007_- I teach in a bilingual program where we use CLIL methodology to help our students with their English while we work on Maths, Science, History etc... There are no limitations to join in the program but the number of places offered. If the demand exceeds the offer then the places are drawn. Nevertheless, parents (and teachers) tend to think that if their child has struggled with school without getting great results, then they should'n apply to this program because it would be 'too much'. Therefore, the bilingual groups are usually composed of higher achievers. These groups are usually easier to deal with (as their behaviour is far better than a 'regular group') but they do tend to consider themselves as 'the clever ones' and it affects the effort they put on their learning (they often consider bad results as totally unexpected... they ARE smartd, they SHOULD get high qualifications without much effort!\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Beginning on one side of the room, each child in turn is given a multiplication fact to complete with the correct answer or return to their seats. A limited amount of time is given to each student because the teacher does not want to \\waste too much time\\\". The same students are left standing at the end each week; these kids are known as the smart kids. The students who return to their seats quickly learn that they are not very smart. The students who are left standing as the last student face the taunts of classmates outside at recess: \\\"teacher's pet\\\" and a variety of other name-calling. Is this scenario from the 60's? Yes, but it is also present in the daily life of the elementary classroom of some schools in 2013. The clear message is that you need to be fast and correct in order to be smart. In a world of high-stakes testing, teachers worry more and more about time. Learning needs to be fast-paced, fast enough to present the correct outcomes on the mid-year and end-of-the-year tests. But not all children find their own understanding of mathematical concepts like multiplication on the same timetable. It is also very disheartening to see that we still have not overcome the stereotype of girls are not good at math. Why would any teacher want a child to believe that they were not capable of success in some area of mathematics just because their skin color is not white? Equity means success for all.

In our school, we have moved to an \\inclusion\\\" model, where all classes are mixed ability groups and a regular education and a special education teacher or a English-language Learning teacher provide scaffolding and support for students in the same classroom.  In classrooms where this is working best, the are good partnerships between the two teachers, and students are flexibily grouped and supported by the resource teacher at any point where they need assistance or enrichment, within the classroom or in a quick pull-out group.  In classrooms where this is not so successful, the teachers are territorial about their \\\"own\\\" students,so tracking is actuallly occuring and lower level students are reluctant to ask for help and draw attention to themselves; higher level students sometimes balk at needing the SPEd teacher as well if the adults have drawn those lines._x0007_Your questions on attendance and disruptive students are spot-on in identifying the ways just a few students can derail a classroom.

Generally we have little control over the situations that we find ourselves teaching in and rather than lamenting the fact we can consciously develop a culture to militate against the development of a fixed mindset. When working with a group of students that have been deemed low achievers, teachers should continue to maintain high expectations and provide challenging tasks. Recently I have worked as an intervention teacher, working with small groups of students, withdrawn from the classroom, deemed to be low achievers (selected by the classroom teacher). I endeavored to develop a situation where students would continue to believe in themselves as learners of maths, each group addressed as I have come for the mathematicians.

If we look at the instructional approach, we agree that the method of instruction varies.  Some teachers have patience and others will with high levels of frustration learn to disregard those students who cannot understand the procedures of solving the math problems.  It sends a non-verbal and in some cases verbal message to the students of \\you will never learn math!\\\"  So we end up losing a lot of students who could embrace the language of math and use it in the real world.

Our principal has arranged the schedule so that will work for her to support the kids with math goals in Special Ed.  Also there are 2 SPED teachers and they divide the case load by grade.

I don't know if you can manage that kind of a shift, it usually requires some whole school buy in. What is nice about it is that the kids don't miss the grade-level curriculum.  Also it is wonderful to have 2 teachers in the room for math.  What hasn't worked is that the same kids get pulled into a group in the classroom for some work on the more remedial aspect of the lesson.  They are denied that high- level, open-ended thinking  We know this isn't working, but it seems that the kids do need some basic number sense skills before they can delve into the lesson. This year will be different.  Both the SPED teacher and I were trained on math recovery this spring and are both able to pull students and work with them where they are at that moment, maybe we'd pull 2 kids to the side for a quick lesson or skills practice  but it would be more fluid and they would not be removed them from the classroom or even from the task at hand."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

The problem with the \\outside discussions and not meaningful discussions\\\" brought up by one person can be managed by the teacher; you, as the teacher, need to be sure everyone stays on task.  I love your ideas, <redacted>, about giving the list of learning goals for the unit along with resources and problem sets to reach the goal.  I was not planning on having students work at their own pace, however, but rather give specific goals each night, so that we were all working on the same learning goal the next day in class.  I plan on having the students complete a Math Journal after watching the videos to begin their understanding of the goal, and then in class the following day, journals will be shared with each other, while problem sets are distributed to work on.  Since taking this course, I will focus the problem sets on more challenging problems, rather than \\\"problems which should be mastered after watching the videos.\\\"  I have not had experience with the flipped classroom as yet, but truly believe this is the way to go with education, as during a traditional classroom, it is virtually impossible to give all of my students the individual time they need, while in a flipped classroom, I should be able to get to all students individually or in small groups.  I have the luxury of only having a maximum of 18 students in one class, as I teach in a private school, and that is their standard set.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Thus, this mindset lowers the priority given education. They see lessons and courses as things to be completed; skills learned are not put fully to use because there is minimal pressure to do so. An analogy is learning to drive: You study a book of rules and regulations to pass a test for a learners permit, which is used to actually practice operating the vehicle. You then demonstrate highway and parking skills and are awarded a license. At that point, a marginal (knowledgable, yet unexperienced and potentially dangerous) driver joins all others. It is continued practice, full of trial and errors, that makes this person a more competent driver ... until old age begins reversing the process. The incentives for improvement driving skills are the likelihood of killing oneself or others, loss of driving privileges due accidents, and expense of vehicle repairs and medical costs. Math, like driving, is a series of skills that must be used (applied) in order to be retained, used successfully and improved."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

While I enjoy teaching the honors students, there is a dimension missing in an average classroom once the top students are removed.

Lower achieving students benefit from the knowledge of the higher achievers. They have a greater range of strategies to pull from. The higher achieving students also benefit, having additional opportunities to demonstrate their knowledge to a different audience.

We do not base placements on a standardized test, and teacher judgement and student results are used to change some placements from one year to the next.  One thing I'm not seeing discussed here is learning style.  It really seems to me that some students need more or less time to internalize new ideas and notations, and I try to frame placement when talking to parents and students as being more about style than ability.

Our students, have gained confidence, strive to support their solutions with proofs and, debate their understanding with their peers. As we look forward, the common core standards should continue to support the efforts of teachers to develop the mathematician in each child rather than teach maths as an historical subject just to be memorized and practiced.

For years we have been trying to put all students into the same square peg, even differentiation, is differentiation with a set stereotyped agenda in mind. Obviously, not a lot can be immediately changed concerning what I am mandated to teach. The introduction of the common core state standards will help. As a teacher, it is my responsibility to offer a flexible learning environment where students have the opportunity to engage in, experiment in, discover learning without the pressures of must haves and have to's. How to be able to implement this while still adhering to district mandates is an interesting proposition. One simple concept I can change is the need for all students to have mastery over the rote aspects of mathematics. The forced need to memorize math facts is no longer a priority. Students should be able to arrive at a math solution a variety of ways. Allowing students the freedom to explore math, as opposed to simply solve algorithms is something I can achieve in my class."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

They then are required to take the notebook home nightly and use it to study by, as to do homework by, so if they forget how to do something, it is in the notebook.  At the beginning of the year, the parents are told about the notebook, so that they know they can look in it also, to learn how to do a new method.  It also gives the parents an opportunity to admire the child's work in the notebook.  Notebooks are generally checked at least once a month, oftentimes weekly in the beginning.  Notebooks include a table of contents to help them find what they need to study / do.  The notebook idea went over so well, that other core subjects are doing it also.  The other benefit, is when the child swears they haven't been taught the method, the proof is in the notebook, if not theirs (cause they refused to write / whatever) it will be in a classmates.

In addition, the first time that a student is held accountable for their own learning is Algebra 1.  This is the first math course that they encounter that requires them to show mastery before moving on.  Students can literally fail math from kindergarten through 8th grade, but will typically still be passed on to the next grade level.  The \\buck stops\\\" at high school Algebra, where so many students are completely unprepared that they fail.  It is difficult to factor if you don't know your multiplication facts.  It is difficult to find the slope of the line if you don't understand the concept of a fraction or how to plot points, which in turn makes it impossible to find the equation of a line given 2 points.

Once I can get a student to take the first step of identifying their variables, and writing them out explicitly (\\\"a = the number of apples; p = the number of pears\\\") then we talk about the difference between the number of apples, and the cost of the apple.  A variable can represent any quantified characteristic of an object.  That is why writing down what a variable represents is so important. In a different problem I might have 'a' present the cost of an apple, if that is the unknown thing I'm trying to figure out.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Administrators and teachers believed that students would be best served to be taught with others who would progress at a similar rate of understanding.  With all the new research and awareness of how this in not most beneficial to learners we need to shift our thinking and utilize students' strengths to the benefit of all who are in a class.  One of the best examples of this I find is when students peer teach.  They can talk out their understanding and ideas while at the same time seeing another persons perspective.  _x0007_One of the comments that resonated with me was when Jo talked about teaching to the middle of the pack and not challenging students enough.  I feel very strongly that all students need to feel challenged and that even those who might require additional support when learning something new should still be challenged to engage in the more difficult problems.  We as teachers can easily adjust the volume f work that is assigned to students, but we should not sacrifice the complexity of the material believing that our students are not capable of handling it.  _x0007_I teach at a school where the majority of our students have diagnosed LD (approx 75%) and the remainder have either undiagnosed challenges learning in a typical school environment or have had very negative past experiences and wish to learn with a more structured and supportive environment.  We have often grouped our classes on perceived ability.  We are starting to move away from this classification in the hopes that we can still provide the necessary support for each student but also expose each of them to challenging material.  As I mentioned above, I believe that past grouping was done with their success put first, but perhaps not in recognizing that this was not the case.  I am looking forward to seeing how a more heterogenous group will perform and I am excited to see some of my students who have not had success in the past work through challenging material and succeed."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

We have both problems: teachers who don't know the math deeply enough for themselves, and who don't know how to teach for understanding.

High achieving students quickly become bored with lessons like that done earlier in this lesson at the mathshell.org website. The lessons would engage lower-achieving students and allow them to discover what they know and add to their learning, but when students have mastered understanding of those concepts, having to go over them in such exploratory detail leads them to despise math. It seems we are failing low achievers or we are failing high achievers. The only solution I can think of besides grouping is an assessment-based path through which all students have to work their way. Still students would know who was ahead and who was behind.

I live in Fairfax Co., VA just outside of Washington, DC, and it has been considered one of the most progressive areas in the country for gifted education.  [Not bragging so much as providing context]  While we still have a system that 'groups' gifted kids for services at the elementary level (called Level IV Centers), the thinking amongst the Gifted leadership is that while Level IV Centers are a valuable opportunity for students to work with like-minded peers in a setting with high expectations and extended curriculum, it may not be necessary to achieve the desired outcomes through those centers exclusively.  The county is in the process of expanding the capacity of all teachers to differentiate in any classroom, providing resource teachers to facilitate differentiation and learning, and raising the expectations for all students.  We are working with a population where a significant number of students come to school well-prepared for a challenging curriculum, and whose parents are largely well-educated and committed to high standards for their children.  [Again, not bragging].  I also know that many of the Title 1 schools lag behind on achievement benchmarks not because of staff limitations, but because the cultural/socio-economic factors affecting student achievement haven't been sufficiently addressed to ensure success for those students. _x0007_I'm always interested in hearing from teachers/parents in less-affluent or metropolitan areas how gifted education is perceived and approached.  I think it is dangerous to think that students can only be served in one particular model.  I believe we need to move more toward Differentiation for Learning than separating populations based on perceived need at one particular time."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

It would be difficult to give every student the test a page at a time and keep track of where every student left off.  Where would they finish the test?

Just as teaching is complex, so is the actual learning of mathematics.  From my personal experience as an Algebra teacher for 7 years, I've observed a snow ball effect of sorts. I think it starts with a single bad experience that then continues to compound over and over again. For our students who are chronically underserved by the mathematics classroom, I believe that a continuous sense of failure prevents them from engaging in the material.  The students continue to move on year after year, but they never build any content knowledge. By the time they are in middle school they are facing this huge wall of fractions, decimals, number lines, that they never really understood, and now  they have to apply it to Algebra and more abstract thinking. The classroom sizes at middle school are huge and if the teacher hasn't mastered classroom management, small groups aren't likely to happen which means these kids, the ones who need it most, aren't getting the individual attention they actually need. _x0007__x0007_I don't believe that any one factor is completely at fault, but we have a system that isn't working."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Both implied that it is necessary to allow students TIME to understand concepts and make connections. _x0007__x0007_At this point it struck me that this is not just about lessons. Teachers need to have class policies, procedures and grading that demonstrate to students that they believe mistakes are acceptable, they will allow students time to learn and they believe their students WILL be successful.

Thankfully, the flipside of the disinterest my administrators feel in my subject means that I have a huge amount of freedom in regard to pedagogy and curriculum. _x0007_One of the most successful changes I have implemented as the Head of Department is in the area of assessment. Instead of formal tests or exams each student fills in a profile sheet at the beginning of each term. The sheet asks them to specify six goals (one each in six areas of skill) from a selection which spans a large range of proficiencies (from beginner/primary to tertiary level).  Students self-assess where they want to work on this sliding scale and what they believe they want to/need to achieve in order to progress. We discuss this in groups (and individually if necessary) but I will never change a student's selection.  They then have all term to demonstrate their six skills to the class and themselves at any time they choose. They can have as many attempts at demonstrating the skill as they like, every week if they choose or only once a term if they choose. Once they have demonstrated understanding by applying it successfully to a problem (not one posed by me but one that they or their peers came up with), I sign their profile sheet and congratulate them. Seems to work really well...motivated kids who apply themselves to the practice some of these skill take and who put thought into how their skill development can be used in real-life problem solving."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

This will be new for our students, so it will take some time to turn around their existing conceptions about what goes on in a math class."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Respond with only one of the options shown and label the following text: As many have noted, all of these seem to play into one-another. If we work backward from where the problem exists, perhaps there are issues around *how* material is presented at the college level. This can be compared to how it is presented at the 7-12 level, often reflected in procedures/formula-focused-content-specific \\drive\\\" to complete chapters. The material is presented from the math-expert's (teacher) standpoint, the single-subject teacher; whereas, at an elementary level the material is (hopefully) presented from a teaching standpoint, the multiple-subject teacher with methods courses behind him/her to support teaching/learning for all. At the next level, again moving backwards, it is possible that Algebra continues to be the \\\"gate-keeper,\\\" as our math department chair calls it. If students are successful in Algebra, the doors open to other mathematics. It is essential that students *understand* the material of course, so simply earning an A in Algebra is not equivalent to long-term understanding or conceptual synthesis. Moving along, it is also possible that students simply do not have the foundational knowledge necessary for success - which loops all of these together. How are we teaching elementary students? Are we teaching for understanding? Are we assessing FOR learning rather than as a measure to check the end of the chapter in a book? Are we using multiple approaches and are we considering multiple procedures for finding an answer? Is the \\\"right\\\" answer (the algorithm) always the answer itself? Do we discuss math and make it part of common classroom culture (much like the literacy corner or Word Wall)? The list goes on... but leads back to the foundational understanding which links to the last thought: students believe they don't have the ability. I will end by saying math came easy to me, I breezed through math in ES and MS, it became a bit more challenging in HS but I relied on my ability to memorize and use formulas in MS to make the most of HS math. College courses in undergrad were mostly GE requirements, and later methods courses for my teaching credential; however, it wasn't until I was *teaching* math that I finally UNDERSTOOD what the underlying mathematics were. I have had so many epiphany moments since beginning as a 2nd grade teacher 15 years ago.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

For many years, just getting the work in meant the student earned an A.  I don't believe this is beneficial because it does not incite motivation or achievement; instead, students just get the work done so they can turn it in.  I plan on discussing this with students, parents, and administration, alike, at the start of the school year.  For instance, I see the students who complete the \\\"black\\\" level as you state above would be A students, the \\\"blue\\\" would signify B work, and the \\\"green,\\\" C work, since it is on-level.

When I have looked at schools that use ability grouping I often wonder, Would I want my own child in that group? Why or why not?  What I began to realize is that my view of success in education was not the same as the teachers. As ability grouping is not a requirement where I live, teachers who use it do so for many different reasons. Some have said it makes their preparation easier and others have said that they can target specific learning better. Unfortunately what is often considered a specific learning target is a defined task to be assessed, graded, and forgotten. I believe that if more teachers understood about fixed and growth mindset they would abandon ability grouping.  Many teachers often feel too busy to question why they do the things they do or what successful learning really looks like."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

We were able to ask them to analyze and discuss rich literature more deeply because they could actually read it!  Should all our students always be reading the same thing?  Surely not.  (NOTE: We also have shared reading novels that ALL students hear read aloud and read along with. Perhaps such a balance can be found in mathematics instruction?)

When they realize that they can learn they are elated in the first place and then shortly become very upset about what the system did to them. They basically went to 12 years of school for nothing. sometimes this upset almost turns to rage. I am very pleased that hardly any of this type of student can't be successful in our math program.

For example, if I wish the children to use groups to count (Grade 1), then the intro will have them practicing skip counting by 5 or 2's etc.  Then they work in arbitrary groups which change every day.  I wish them to be exposed to many different methods of thinking.  We call this a three part lesson (the third part being a whole group review of the work of the students where they comment on the math).  I am sure others are using it.  At first everyone wants to work with the 'smart' person in the class, but over the course of the year that changes.  I had never thought about it before, but I think this goes a long way toward dispelling the myth that only some can learn math.

My school has recently implemented tracking for year 7 (the lowest year level) as a means to lift the abysmal test results that students have been getting. However the ability grouping has been narrowly defined (by test scores and teacher judgements in one area of maths) and what we have found is that there is still wide variation of student ability levels in each class. As a further consequence, students now feel that their maths ability has been determined (i.e. developed a fixed mindset) and teacher expectations have been altered accordingly._x0007_To adequately cater for the top students in mixed ability (or indeed streamed) classes, teachers need to reconsider their pedagogy - ensure that the tasks they set up are open-ended and accessible by all students, with opportunity for extension and prompting for those in need._x0007_If a goal of maths education is to get students to think like mathematicians and be curious and investigative about the subject, we are definitely doing them a disservice when class groupings serve to encourage a fixed mindset."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

I'm a new teacher in Ontario, working as a math tutor and writing a math course for an online high school when I'm not trying to pay my bills working at a pub. I'm taking this course to increase my comfort and familiarity with online education and online math both because I'm way over time on the course I have in development (I just want it to actually be good...) and because I will likely be taking additional qualifications to teach high school math (currently I'm certified for grades 4-10) this fall and will likely take it online. _x0007__x0007_I'm a surprised convert to online education. I hated my experience with LMS during my undergraduate degree both as a student and as a TA (for a humanities course with loads of discussion opportunities). I decided to take the jump at an opportunity to work with an online high school, felt overwhelmed and unsupported so I turned to the math teacher community on twitter and have been absolutely floored by the quality and kindness of that community. I'm really excited about the opportunities that technology has made available for learners (Desmos, oh my!) and for me as an underemployed teacher in a tough job market._x0007__x0007_I think it's really fantastic that Jo has put this together and am really grateful for the opportunity.

Students who were clearly far above the others in terms of their understanding were not challenged at all because the class was taught to the middle and low-achieving students in the class.  The teacher had low expectations of students and often reminded me that we were constrained in what we could teach because they were the low kids.  Students clearly picked up on this and began to have low expectations for themselves as well, not turning in work or completing assignments that they viewed as busywork (because they were!!)._x0007_\t_x0007_I am currently reading Robyn Jacksons book, Never Work Harder Than Your Students.  In this book, Jackson discusses the idea of tracking using the analogy of jumping over a rope.  She explains it in the following way: suppose your goal is that students will be able to jump over a rope that is at least two feet off the ground.  If you set up a rope two feet off the ground exactly, the students who can do it immediately will have nothing to do once they jump over it once or twice, and the students who have trouble will continue to struggle with a static, repetitive task.  If you set the rope up seven feet off the ground, you run into the same problem, but this time you have more students struggling and receiving messages that they are not good enough.  If, however, you set up a rope that is two feet off the ground at one end, and 10 feet off the ground at the other, students are able to grow and challenge themselves, no matter what their starting point.  The key with this is that regardless of their starting points, all students are at the very least exposed to the high expectations further down the rope.  Even the students who are working to jump over a two-foot-high rope can anticipate moving along the rope towards the 10-foot end.  It is this heterogeneous grouping, where students starting points are respected but where all students are still exposed to a challenging environment regardless of their starting point, that leads to the best learning."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

The second reason, that goes hand in hand with the first reason, is that students are taught the algorithm of how to find an answer to a problem. The quick easy way to find the answer. However they don't understand what it is they are doing. Students just want to know if they are to multiply or divide. There is way more than one way to come to an answer, you could multiply or divide to solve the problem. They don't have the basics because it does take longer to learn, and therefore teach.By the time I get them they are just looking for an algorithm to plug the numbers into, and I teach 3rd grade."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

So the district office admin have been saying that the majority of our kids will still be taking algebra in 8th grade even with Common Core. I have been disagreeing with them, and most of the teachers seem to agree with me, so hopefully this will change. However, we are designing \\Advanced 6th\\\" and \\\"Advanced 7th\\\" grade classes and smashing the 6-8th standards into 2 years. So if a student doesn't get into the high 6th class she will miss 1/2 of the 7th grade standards if she starts in 7th grade. Plus, the students will still be tested at grade level, so in 7th grade they will have learned 1/2 of the 7th standards and all of the 8th, but the test is on the 7th grade only. Same with 8th grade. I know our district will never go away from the honors level classes, but there has to be a better way in middle school to get this done! We just can't seem to figure it out!\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

This is a very mathematically rich activity which requires the past experiences of each member of the cohort in order to succeed. Is the suggestion that this activity could be delivered as successfully with a group with wide diversity? How could a student with limited success with exponents access Pythagoras, forming quadratic functions and solving them, all in the same session? I have worked in a school where there was an experiment with mixed ability groupings in maths. No prior training was given as the expectation was that all teachers should be able to differentiate and personalise every lesson for every student. As is seen on this forum, a fixed mindset kicks in when confronted with the practicalities of time and resources. One immediate solution to the challenge was to set different groups of students different work which became unsustainable. I retain the fixed mindset that groupings can promote a growth mindset.

On the other hand I have seen times where higher students were brought \\\"down\\\" in that they did not want to take advantage of the more challenging work.  Once done the base level of work they were happy to coast.  _x0007__x0007_Currently I really struggle with how to incorporate very low kids learning with the broader range of things going on in the classroom.  I teach math and science to grades 7 - 9.  Last year we had classes with a mix of low and regular students.  When I say low I mean their literacy and math is grade 1 - 4 level.  We had all sorts of differentiation we did but in the end we were essentially \\\"tracking\\\" the kids within the class.  This year we will be separating the lower kids out into a tracked class for math and science. The idea being we can deviate further from grade level curriculum and try to get basic skills taught.  I am excited by the prospect that I could help a grade 8 student bring their math skills from a grade 2 to a grade 4 or 5 level instead of trying to make it appear that they are doing grade 8 math.  That would be virtually impossible to do in a regular mixed classroom.  On the other hand am still very nervous about the negative impacts of a tracked class.  Not sure which is the best way to go.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Respond with only one of the options shown and label the following text: I teach in the UK to 11 to 16 yr olds. I have been at this same school for 7 years. Every year group is set by 'ability'. This is basically decided on by the test they have at the end of the year before but we also give a teacher assessment and base this on work in class and homework. My Head of Department (HOD) is very reasonable and if we can justify where we think a student should go, then he is willing to listen and often moves that student on our advice. _x0007_I think the reason why we set the year groups is to make teachers lives easier. It is a hard enough job anyway, with OFSTED (government inspectors) rating the school and it's teachers on a scale of 1 to 4. If you are rated as a 3, you are satisfactory but you are made to feel that that is not good enough. Likewise if you are graded a 2, good, you feel you should be achieving a 1, outstanding. Having to fully differentiate every lesson for every class and provide the necessary resources is exhausting. If there was a bank of resources made for every lesson, suitable for every child, it would be possible but there are just not enough hours in the day to create/adapt lessons for everything you could possible need. And an exhausted teacher is no good to anyone. I think it will take a long time to move forward unless more teachers/schools/countries are willing to and have the time to share their good resources. _x0007_This year we are trying an experiment where we are teaching our year 9s as mixed ability except for the 'top' set. We have had a lot of comments from parents and my school is very driven by them. My HOD has had to write many letters explaining why we are trying out this way of teaching. Parents will need to be educated in this way if we are to move forward in this respect. _x0007__x0007_I cannot see how giving the higher achievers the message \\you're smart\\\" can be damaging to them. Surely by letting them see their own achievements they believe more in themselves and then we tell them that we expect even more from them and give them the most challenging of problems but still explain to them that part of progressing is to make mistakes to learn from them and then to push themselves harder.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

I think it has to do with not understanding it. _x0007_ I think of my own math experience.  I always got all As in my math classes, but I don't think I understood a thing, consequently I had no interest in continuing.  Then a group of educators came from England to give workshops to teachers interested in the British Infant schools approach to teaching math through manipulatives and problem-solving--yes, this was in the sixties, but I still remember the moment when it dawned on me how money work and the beauty of place value.  It was like a lightbulb went off._x0007_Then I think of sending off three young teachers for a math experience with a conceptual-based math teacher and the day one returned saying, \\So that's how it works!\\\"-- another lightbulb. _x0007_Over the years I have seen the same things with students who have the opportunity to explore math using manipulatives, real life experiences, problem-solving -- they LOVE math._x0007_Parents also play a role.  First, it is hard to convince parents that our approach to math is the way in which their children would learn to understand and apply mathematical concepts in a 'thinking' kind of way, how much more important this was than being able to rattle off the math facts.  Why does it always come down to this -- but do they know their math facts?  I have no problem with math facts because knowing them leads to greater fluency and accuracy, but it is not worth the time spent in many classrooms.  The second parent complaint is that they didn't learn math this way, so why weren't their children, conveniently forgetting how much they might have hated math growing up._x0007_Then one of our parents found your book at the local library, which was our introduction to your ideas.  It certainly helped this parent and others to whom we have loaned the book, but more importantly it validated all our thinking based on our observations of students learning math._x0007_Why this course? In recent years I have become complacent.  I have focused on other things within the curriculum.  Finding your course online was the perfect timing.

I get the feeling that there is no flexibility in your school systems (although I don't know where you are all from...). In Sweden there are no national directives about grouping ability. We know from research that heterogeneous groups are preferable, which is why - in the 80s - the Swedish concept of \\A school for everyone\\\" was planted. Of course, as Jo says, there can be positive things about dividing student in ability groups every now and then, as long as the groups don't stay constant over a longer period of time. _x0007__x0007_At my school, with about 480 students from preschool (6-year-olds) to grade 9, we are working a lot with high expectations, both between leaders-personnel and teachers-students. In math class the teacher often provides problems in different severity or open tasks that can be solved in many different ways and different levels. I would be very surprised if I walked in to a classroom where everybody worked on the same page in the same book. The schedule is flexible to a certain part so that students who need more time to learn basics can get the extra time with a teacher. _x0007__x0007_As for the national tests, these are first of all a possibility for the schools and the teachers, to get a guideline of how well their teaching applies to the rest of the country. NOT to violate the students... The tests are supposed to be done in a way that allows every student to show his or her strengths. Then, of course, the teacher must adjust to each student. _x0007__x0007_I'm sure that this sounds pretentious, and of course we still have a lot to work with when it comes to individualizing at my school as well, but at least we've come a bit on the way.

Number talks are part of a method used in Everyday Math which his elementary school adopted. The problem comes back to the difficulty of having a wide range of math achievement in the classroom having one discussion/lesson. Students who see 18 * 5 as a simple problem do not want to talk about how they get the answer more than perhaps once or twice for 5 minutes -- after that they want to move on and they get frustrated when they can't. Specifically, in my son's class the teacher tried a number talk asking how many different ways you can depict the number 8. Students answered things like 4+4, 8*1, 16 / 2, 5 + 3, etc. The talk came to an abrupt end when the answer of \\\"1000\\\" was given and a couple kids recognized that it was binary for 8, but the teacher was flummoxed. Teacher credibility hit zero, those few kids decided not to participate in these \\\"stupid\\\" discussions again (I overheard them discussing it), and the other kids were probably left mystified.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

We technically did away with basic skills however it morphed into something almost the same. Students are now getting double period math in most cases. Students in 7th & 8th grade that score near proficient on the state test take a remedial class that is very worksheet based in consumable booklets. Students are given many pre & post-tests. Lots of data is collected for growth. Teaching math these days make me feel like my creative abilities are being stripped away. The new textbooks was adopted 2 years does come with a 30 minute activity before each lesson. They aren't too bad however they seem too prescriptive.  I strongly agree with not grouping students however with parents used to grouping when they were in school and parents not confident in teacher's ability to differentiate, it's a hard sell. Too often in low level classes, behavior problems arise, student's throw in the towel, and teachers end up spoon feeding the students the material."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Many parents want their children exposed to a \\\"diverse\\\" set of peers, but that doesn't mean disruptive, bullying, or truant students. It is not clear to me whether the overall trend is toward more choice (e.g. charters) or less (economic stratification and growing income inequality). However, in urban public systems like the one where I teach, I think tracking gives hope to the more resourceful families that they can extract their children from the overall system, which performs poorly, and find a pocket of satisfactory teaching/learning. Examples include special schools with test-based admissions and \\\"gifted and talented\\\" programs that start at a very early age. Those exclusive programs receive relatively more resources (e.g. better teachers, facilities), and the students do better.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Respond with only one of the options shown and label the following text: I teach in an adult education program that groups students who are working towards their high school equivalency diplomas in the following ways: A. Math intensive classes: for students who are particularly week in math. They spend 75% of their time in class focusing on mathematics and only 25% on other subjects. We do not see them as not having potential - in fact they are often amongst the most literate/literary students we have and can write reasonably well. However, their gaps in mathematics knowledge can often be best addressed with more time spent working on deep open-ended problems. Grouping them in this class allows them more time for math. B an C are more problematic. Of the remaining pool of students we divide students into two groups according to performance on official practice tests for the high school equivalency exam. The B \\higher\\\" group often is composed of students who need approximately one semester to finish their studies, earn their diploma, and apply to college. The C group is composed of students with larger gaps in knowledge, weaker math and writing, and who often need at least a year of instruction to obtain a diploma. In both groups students are assessed formatively and can progress faster or slower than we initially think. They are not \\\"held back\\\" by their grouping, in theory. But now I am really thinking more deeply about the B and C grouping, and wondering if this division is necessary or desirable. And what affect it has on student learning in both groups.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Respond with only one of the options shown and label the following text: I read some of the other comments below, and I think there are some very valid points supporting and arguing against heterogenious groups.  I think what is really the most harmful is when there are classes created for heterogenious groups (i.e. the slow class, the gifted class, the average class.) I think students can start to pick up on which students are where and labels are made, strong labels because they were *placed* there.  Clearly, higher powers believe they should be there, so that's pretty dominating and they'll start to limit themselves to that label and belief in themselves (let alone all that was talked about of teacher's not giving the same work or expectations, so they fall more and more behind over time, affecting their future academically forever).  I think what can work is when students are put into different groups based on performance of different topics in one whole class.  That way, high-fliers can sore and be challenged and lower-achieving can take more time and understand concepts at a slower pace to keep them challenged as well.  It sucks when the teacher has a mixed group so s/he needs to move towards the middle yet that leaves the low and high behind.  I think differenciating instruction can be really beneficial in a mixed class (what's key though is mixing it up per topic-- one student might be great at estimation but need more time with division) so that it is annonymous, kept unlabeled, and changing.  Maybe groups with different learners would benefit also so the \\smarter\\\" could teach and lower achieving could ask questions.  I don't know how the teacher would lift up those lower achieving students to get to the higher achieving if everyone can go at their own base in their group.  Wouldn't the teacher*need* to get to the middle by the end of the unit, for the take away lesson?_x0007__x0007_I think the most harmful is labeling, so keeping classes mixed and perhaps using different heterogeous groups per topic could be helpful. It would still be damaging if the groups always stayed the same and if they were labeled.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

We've ended up with a solution involving a sort of \\\"limbo\\\" Algebra/Geometry integrated course that delays the grouping decision for a year (but is taught at an accelerated level).  While I feel we approach this in a more political way than I would like, I can see that it could have advantages; maybe we're reducing some of the \\\"borderline casualties\\\" doing it this way._x0007__x0007_2) For my part, I've tried to open up my AP Statistics class to more students; if a student REALLY wants to take the course, I let them -- our school has them sign a contract outlining the expectations for each AP course they take, so they know what they're getting into. (Disclaimer: I do use teacher recommendations for this process, and for each student, I discuss their past math and English achievement with them, as well as the AP Potential tool -- I try not to set students up for failure.) Our AP Calculus teacher also tries to find students in the \\\"middle\\\" groups who might be appropriately challenged by AP Calculus._x0007__x0007_3) Finally, it bears mentioning that all our math teachers look for students to move up and down from track to track from semester to semester.

I would start by giving the students a large set of very easy(boring) problems, then discuss why they are boring by using how children learn basics like walking and talking and how our brains need the adventure of trial and error to really learn, develop new synapses. When learning to walk, for example, a child first holds on to something to get up the courage to take that first independent step, falls many times, even cries at times, but eventually walking is so well learned that we no longer even give it a thought because by trial and error, making mistakes, walking become automatic.  When we know how to do something our brains are ready to move on to something else, get bored with the same old thing over and over. The activities would end with making either contrasting and humorous posters of the bored brain and the brain learning, or making their own posters of \\\"Dare to Learn\\\", to display in the room until daring to make mistakes has become a firm part of the learning culture.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

The only group that seemed to jump by leaps and bounds and eventually overtook the state averages was 3rd grade.  The 3rd grade had three teachers and at the end of each day they gave a one or two problem exit task around math.  In their schedule they had built in a 30 minute remediation block and every day they would sort the students for 30 minutes using the errors on the exit task.  The next day the grouping would be different.  They jumped 10 to 20 % points each year until they were at nearly 80% meeting standard.  This last year they decided to divide teachers into certain subjects, one teacher math, one reading/writing, one social studies AND math intervention.  To accomplish math intervention, they grouped the kids.  It was set for the year.  Their scores dropped 15% points.  They really do believe they are meeting the needs of this lower group and they have some data (real?) from a certain intervention program that shows this group grew.  I am not sure how to get them to look at overall picture and clearly one year doesn't present a trend I realize.  I do know that now all higher grades (3 through 6) ability group and they are so proud of the work they are doing. Yikes, the results on mandated tests are awful."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

I have taught in large comprehensive secondary schools that used grouping by ability level and also small private schools in which the student populations were simply too small to track students.  In the latter case, all students were together and some flexible grouping occurred for core subjects such as reading and maths.  I much preferred teaching in the second environment, primarily because the general ethos of the classes were, on the whole, better.  The lower sets in the first environment tended to be discipline problems and generally, the esteem in which learning was held was much lower.  The higher sets were fun to teach but I don't know that they would have been any less fun if they had included a more comprehensive mix of ability levels._x0007_<p>_x0007__x0007_I now live in a small island country and have taught in three different schools here.  In each, classes were mixed, and there may only have been one class at each grade level, so there has been a wide range of ability levels.  These classes have been enjoyable to teach and challenging in a good way.  We are forced, as teachers, to differentiate our lessons, and because we are dealing with students as individuals, we are also forced to continually reassess their skill levels.  Students are not \\stuck\\\" in one group or another because the teacher is always adjusting his or her perceptions of the students' ability based on current work and progress.  There is generally a more positive view of learning in these classes than in the lower and middle ability groups I have taught previously, and a more cooperative relationships between students and teachers and between students themselves.  When I have taught very low ability groups in the past, I really felt that no matter how much work I put in, I wasn't raising their achievement very much, and their performance on standardized tests certainly bore out my perceptions.  It is very difficult to raise achievement levels in classes where all students have experienced low expectations and low levels of challenge over their whole school careers.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

I think tracking is necessary based on how kids retain information and how quickly they learn. In my high class, I can tell the kids once or twice, and it sinks in. In my lowest class, thinking right now of the few intensely motivated kids, it takes way more repetitions for concepts to sink in. I can think of a girl right now who diligently does all her homework, but it's still hard for her as an 8th grader to tell the difference between mean, median, mode, range, etc. She knows this about herself, but she still tries diligently to improve...In summary I don't see how effective classrooms could be run sans ability grouping/tracking.

I set my classroom up with students sitting in groups of 3 or 4.  The trick is how do I know what students to sit with whom in order to produce the best results for all students in each group.  Mixing groups with high, middle, middle, low is recommended so that the low student can learn from the high and the high student can teach the low.  The other side of the coin is to group students based upon ability.  The high students sitting all together are suppose to push each other to achieve better and the low students much work to learn since no high student is in the group to give out answers._x0007__x0007_So what do I do???  I am thinking of putting my students together by current score in my class.  With round of assessment, student groups change.  A student who might have been in the low group one unit of learning can find him/her self in the high group with the next assessment.  I will also be placing the lower groups in the front of the room and the higher groups in the back.  This will also hopefully get the lower groups more engaged in the class since they can no longer hide behind their classmates.  The higher students will continue to vie for teacher attention no matter where they sit._x0007__x0007_A colleague of mine who use this practice last year, found that her students quickly raised their assessment scores so no one what sitting in the front of the room, directly next to the teacher desk (the low of the lows).  My colleague never told the students how she was seating them, they intuitively figured it out and made sure their personal level of achievement was high enough to keep them away from teacher."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Although the average student in my classes was still not at the national average, they were closer than a year before, and a big deal should be made of that effort and progress.  A year ago, the only reward was for percent passing an end of level test, and student readiness coming in was a large factor in demonstrating success.  One teacher had 30 honors students, and I had none.  His students passed at a higher rate than mine (duh).  _x0007_     I had students who could have passed the end of year test at the beginning of the year, so for them, the way to measure success is improvement.

Respond with only one of the options shown and label the following text: I was taught about that similar study Jo mentions about the teacher having higher expectations so the random group of students performing at the top of their peer group when I was in college. It shaped my whole way of thinking and I've been adamantly against ability grouping since I started teaching. Every time it's brought up, I fight it. I have been unsuccessful in fighting ability grouping for 1/2 an hour a day in my building for a language arts piece. In math, however, I chose to ability group when I first started adapting my teaching to allow for more open tasks like the ones we've discussed here in this lesson. I felt that by making smaller groups I would be able to better manage my classroom with minimal chaos as a rookie teacher. My math results were good the first few years and I've received a lot of praise for my math. Unfortunately, it's not my math approach that's being respected, but rather the groups. I stopped doing groups last year as I finally grew comfortable enough to approach open tasks as a whole class and still feel like I was meeting all student needs and I continue to see good scores.Those looking at my classroom continue to neglect the approach I take and continue to think I still ability group. It is something that is highly praised and in some cases has been forced in my building. In order to add something productive to this discussion, I will say that Jo's point about teaching to the middle when ability grouping and being more aware in heterogeneous groups and therefore differentiating is true. Creating an environment for a growth mindset is key. Students work together and the teacher can work with a student and give feedback, but it's actually much easier to differentiate in these types of classrooms because mistakes are embraced and questions are encouraged."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Respond with only one of the options shown and label the following text: I think math is a problem for many students in the US because of the teaching methods taught in schools and colleges. Classes don't always allow for students to process the information learned at their own pace. Often, time is not allowed for students to think through the information given on their own, to ask themselves whether their process or the answer makes sense, nor do they have time to discuss the information with others. I believe students need to develop strategies to preview the information given, to understand what is being asked of them in the question or prompt, and to be able to go through a process to problem solve. The process of solving the problem is more important than the final answer. Time should also be given to discuss the problem with others. I think in high school, teachers feel pressure to get through their curriculum and instead of helping students develop problem solving strategies and ways to recognize and look at different problems, some instructors just given the answers and students think their job is to just copy notes or copy work from the board."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

I ask questions as needed and then we usually debrief at the end of the time about what they noticed, what worked, etc.  It is amazing to me.  Even grouping two children together that have behaviour problems (something I never would have done in the past) leads to thinking and learning.  Not only are they engaging with the math, they are figuring out how to function with another person.  And, seeing themselves as capable and accountable - having something valuable to offer.  So often in the past, these kids would let the 'smart' ones do everything and hang back in the shadows of activity.  They weren't engaged or excited, but let others do their learning for them.  This has all changed.  Everyone is engaged.  Everyone is thinking and learning.  And, everyone is being pushed out of their comfort zones.  (Especially me.)

In the beginning, the students do seem to feel very \\\"tracked\\\", but over the year they express appreciation for the extra help, pride in their successes, and comment that they can finally ask the questions that they want to without feeling dumb.  We are continuing to follow these students to see if they can now keep up with their peers.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

To be good readers, we know that TIME reading aids this.  Do we allow \\free math time?\\\" Do children seek it out?  Can we apply the same thinking to math that we do to reading?

In the Math classrooms, students are heterogeneously grouped and are encouraged to work at their own pace.  I teach first grade and very rarely are any students working on the same page or concept in the Math book.  In the upper elementary school grades, students could be working on two different Math books completely, depending on how quickly they achieved mastery of a concept.  So, we do not track or group by an achievement or aptitude test, but some students are doing more advanced work because they have worked through and mastered a concept more quickly than others.  _x0007__x0007__x0007_----------_x0007_A downside of what we do is that we rarely meet as a group to discuss and talk about Math concepts.  Work is mostly done on paper, by oneself, independently. Although students can move ahead to more advanced work I wonder if they are really developing any depth of understanding or ability to think flexibly about Math problems.  They are also missing out on important opportunities to collaborate with peers and to explain their thinking.  _x0007_In addition to this, I feel we are still supporting a fixed mindset. Success is judged by the right answer, because the right answer moves you ahead.  Yes, the student's make mistakes, and that is an opportunity for discussion with the teacher.  Yet the student's have to correct those mistakes, so they know that  it is through mistakes that they learn new concepts.  I feel our environment is somewhat unique and deserves more deeper consideration.  However, I do sense that more group discussion is essential.  The question is, what paper work am I going to cut so that I can put in the group discussion work.  This is a great time to figure that out - before school starts."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

However, not every student is super high in math. In my 2nd grade class I had a few students who really needed to be taught the 2nd grade curriculum at a slow pace but a majority of my class understood most of the math concepts without being taught the material. It is really challenging teaching a class that is so differentiated. At my school we begin to group for math starting in 3rd grade. However, the way we group is that we give a pre assessment at the beginning of each topic and the groups are done based on a child's score on the pre assessment. This means that every unit the groups change. I was surprised to see how much they do change each topic. Obviously there are a few kids that stay in the same group for the entire year but it seems that each child excels in a different area of math. I like that they get the opportunity to switch each unit. I think it is easier for teachers because there is a smaller scale of differentiation in each group. I will say that i think all of our students are challenged regardless of the group they are in. However, the research has made me think maybe the way we do it isn't the best."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

A large fraction of elementary school teachers did not have positive experiences in learning mathematics during their elementary through high school mathematics education.

In a larger class setting (20+ students) time alloted for teaching of math concepts is limited, but the biggest part to this is that if one wants to spend more time teaching using manipulatives, having students dialogue about their different approaches and solutions, wrestle with questions so they are discovering concepts, this all takes a great deal more time and great skills in management.

The pre-asssessment that was given indicated that most were in the middle, small group proficient with those concepts and a small group still needing more work with addition, subtraction and place value. Due to the rigorous demands of the common core requirements for third grade they have to begin instruction with multiplication. Some concerns were raised about trying to build when there is not a solid foundation, the pressures of common core, differentiating.It was an excellent discussion but the reality is the common core dictates the instructional units.

I know that this is an issue that the intermediate teachers face at my school. With upwards of 28 students in the class and abilities from grade 2 through to high school level the task of teaching math is quite daunting. Add to that poor work ethic or attendance due to family issues and teaching becomes more problematic. Many teachers, especially those in large classes or those who are uncomfortable teaching math tend to send lower achieving students to the resource room. The result, in my opinion, is that student achievement declines further--students are really feeling like they cannot achieve if they can't be in the room with their peers. For mixed ability grouping to work effectively teachers cannot simply rely on the textbook. A lot of work needs to be done to create a classroom environment of positive dialogue and team work. Teachers also need to be willing to take time to ensure student understanding and take the time to give good feedback for learning."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Students have no choice in their math through grade 10. In grades 11 & 12 they pick classes with guidance from their teachers.  The MA state standards and MCAS test says kids have to be able to solve quadratics.  I personally agree with the person above that I don't believe that to be a necessary skill.

When we track, we put kids on a fixed path that due to prerequisites, they can never veer from.  Kids can go down a level, but in math, it is hard to go up a level as usually math is tracked in such a way that kids in upper levels take courses a year early.  So if someone gets stronger in math as they age, they haven't had the prerequisites to move into the upper level without taking a make up course.  With heterogeneous grouping and playing with abilities within a class, all students have the same basic concepts but can develop them to different depths.  If a student better understands one concept over another, they can move more deeply into that concept and spend more time on the basics of another.  Their pacing varies over the course of the year.  The problem right now is that college counselors are pressuring kids to take calculus to be competitive for colleges.  I find myself fighting this constantly with the argument, that I'd rather have the student take a course more suited to their current development and do well, then to take a course that looks challenging on paper only to \\fail\\\" or feel like they are failing. There is a top-down affect.  High schools want to prepare kids to be successful in college, middle school wants to prepare kids to be successful in high school, etc. But in doing so, we are not necessarily doing what is developmentally appropriate at each grade level.  We need to take their brains where they are and work within the developmental confines of them at that point.  Learning can't take place if the work is too easy OR too hard.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

I can even prepare for a late afternoon parent phone call asking about this new development in the classroom, whether it is a math grouping, a spelling group switch, or reading group.  I do think heterogenous grouping works best in the elementary classroom.  The teacher can work with small ability groups within the classroom, but also accommodate different groupings in other ways.  Sometimes a stronger and a weaker student can be paired for an activity.  If small groups are working on a project, a lower ability student can be grouped with higher ability students.

One instructional approach that I found particularly effective was math stations. Math stations are typically used at the elementary level, but they also work REALLY well at the HS level. I was able to differentiate through stations, where students were all working on the same content/concepts, just with different scaffolds available through certain stations. For example, while 5 of the 6 stations were the same for all students, one station offered two \\at level\\\" and \\\"above level\\\" options for students to consider. Also, if certain students needed initial help, I had them start at the \\\"teacher-facilitated station\\\" so that I could start them strong in the process.

Respond with only one of the options shown and label the following text: At the end of last year, I happened upon a product in Teachers Pay Teachers called the L.I.N.K. Math Workshop Framework by Colleen Patton.  It is basically a guided math program that uses both whole group, small group, mixed ability and similar ability groupings with rotations.  LINK stands for: _x0007_L - Learning with manipulatives_x0007_I - Independent work_x0007_N - New math_x0007_K - Keep it up games_x0007__x0007_This is a very empowering program.  On Mondays, you preview the week.  Then half of the class is doing an extension of previous learning and/or a preassessment of a coming unit while the other half is doing Linking Leaders and Co-leaders, DISCOVERING how to play a new game that they can teach the others.  every day, they all write in their math journals about something they learned that was significant to them.  On Tuesday through Friday, the teacher presents 2-3 minilessons, meet with 2-3 groups, and students will go to a LINK._x0007_After analyzing the pre-assessments, the teacher divides the class into two seperate groupings.  The first is a mixed ability group that gets a mini lesson on the current whole group unit of study.  The students are strategically paired so that they have a partner to work with at the independent station, even though they will have different assignments, in case they have questions.  They have the same partner for at least one week.  All students are also grouped into similar ability groups, where the teacher can focus on a common area of need with each group.  There are 4 mixed groups, but only 3 similar ability groups, allowing for one extra session for the similar ability group with the most needs.  These groups are very fluid based on the assessing.  at the end of every lesson cycle (between and after the mixed ability groups and the similar ability groups), there is a check in session with all students at the carpet to talk about their experiences and strategies.  I am just getting ready to implement this, as I see it as a powerful way to implement Rti (Response to Intervention) within my own class.  I feel it is important to give all kids what they need, and this is a way to validate each student.  I was always in higher groups, because we were tracked in high school, but my best friend was in the dummy classes.  They were all given D's to pass and never learned anything.  She didn't know how to make change or multiply or anything when she graduated.  I never want any student of mine to feel useless because all students can reach a level of success"}], "max_tokens": 3}}

I can see how other teachers create groups can send bad messages to students and make them feel as if they are in the \\low\\\" group and wish that there was a way to stop this in all classrooms. I can also see how teachers and their expectations can impede student achievement.  I believe that the higher you set the bar the higher they will reach.  I do not believe in giving \\\"lower / higher\\\" work to students with different abilities.  I do remediate my groups that are struggling with a skill using different techniques and I provide enrichment activities to my students that I know understand the skills being taught.  I do agree that \\\"borderline casualties\\\" can come into play.  However, I typically have a classwork, home and quiz assignment completed before changing groups.

Respond with only one of the options shown and label the following text: There are so many enlightening things that Cathy displayed during her number talk. The first was that when she asked the students for answers to the question 25 x 29 and one student gave his answer, Cathy asked if anyone else had a different answer. That is good because some teachers might just start lecturing; however another student said her answer and the first student quickly realized his mistake. This leads into the next thing i noticed. Instead of going forward describing the right answer, Cathy wanted to follow through with how the first student got his incorrect answer. Afterward, cathy acknowledged that the question was hard, mentioned that his thought process was interesting and asked if other students made a similar mistake. I think that during the class discussion acknowledging the question was difficult is a huge deal, because it then makes it ok if someone got the question wrong. Cathy also called the students incorrect thought process \\interesting\\\" which is much better than say words like \\\"wrong\\\" or \\\"incorrect\\\". Finally, Cathy engages the entire class again by asking if there were similar mistakes made. _x0007__x0007_Later on in the number talk, Cathy asked if any of the students solved the problem in a completely different way and put those answers on the board. Lastly, one thing that stood out to me was when Cathy asked the students to express the different methods in drawings or equations, she asked the students to write on their desks with their fingers. This is a subtle point but it is allowing the students to bring the problem from the abstract word in their minds to the physical world, on the table. This is an important observation because sometimes students get lost in process of their mind and its better to have things written out or, in this case, air written so the students can \\\"see\\\" the problem better.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

As Jo Boaler whipped through the explanation in a couple of nano seconds, I was left in the dust and feeling quite bruised -- not sure if I still wanted to continue the play.  So I emailed my son.  The exchanges are copied to below:_x0007__x0007_Hi -- Sam takes 3 hours to paint a house, Joe takes 5 hours,  How long does it take for both of them together?  It's not intuitive to me that it will take less than 3 hours, but that appears to be the case.  (I would think that Joe would slow Sam down.)_x0007_Anyway 1/3 + 1/5 = 8/15.  for how much is painted in one hour. _x0007_ [This is where I get lost:  multiply by 15/8 and get the answer.]  _x0007_  The answer is 1 7/8 hours.  _x0007_huh?_x0007_something about a + b / axb_x0007__x0007_Answer: If it takes Sam 3 hours to do the house, he does 1/3 of the house in an hour = 5/15. Likewise, Joe does 1/5 = 3/15. So together they do 5/15 + 3/15 =8/15 of the house per hour. That's the rate. . _x0007_The basic equation you're solving for is: R*T=D, where in this case D=amount of house to paint, R=rate of painting, and T=time. So for this example, it is:_x0007_(8/15) * T = 1_x0007_So T = 15/8_x0007__x0007_Reply:  Ok. I can plug it into the formula but how does the formula make sense?  I get the rate is 8/15 of a house in one hour. D or distance is the amount of house needed to be painted.  In this case, 1 house. How would you explain 15/8 without the formula?_x0007__x0007_Answer: Not sure what you're asking._x0007__x0007_D = R times T_x0007_if D = 1, R = 8/15, solve for T:_x0007_T = D / R = 1 / (8/15) = 15/8_x0007__x0007_Reply:  Yes. I got the algebra part.  But w/out the algebra equation, how can you explain/justify using 15/8?  For instance I could draw a picture of a house cut into 3 sections and one cut into 5 sections. I could draw another house as my goal (D) w both people painting and show it 8/15 finished after one hour.  By solving it further and taking 7/15 of an hour, 60 minutes, (what is left to complete on the house)  I get 28 minutes.  But how would I illustrate using 15/8? _x0007__x0007_Answer:  That's where you're messing up; it's not 7/15 of an hour left, it's 7/15 of the job. _x0007_I think it would be hard to visualize this, since it's a Time problem without whole numbers. I guess you could show a house divided up into 15ths, and show how many were done after the first hour. But ultimately, since the answer is 15/8, you'd have to get down to how much gets done every 7.5 minutes (1/8th of an hour), which isn't pretty._x0007__x0007_Reply:  Hmmm. Wond"}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Respond with only one of the options shown and label the following text: The information in this session has changed my thinking about my own ability in many ways. For one, it actually transformed a negative attitude that I had placed on myself. I grew up in a low income area and for the most part had really bad teachers. I attribute the fact that I am not \\smart\\\" because I was never properly taught. When I share with people how I felt when I got into a good university, I always say, well, college was hard, I'm not smart, but I just had to work really hard and that's all I could do. Even though my mindset may have sounded like the growth mindset, it wasn't. My mind set was based on the fear of failing and that there was nothing smart in me that I could tap into and therefore had to work hard. Did I appreciate working hard? No. I complained about it every single day wishing that I was smart or could have been taught better in school. So, when I encountered problems that were difficult, I didn't give up, not because I knew I could eventually solve it or that the learning was in the process. I continued to persist because I knew everything was always this difficult. But the difference is with my mindset and the growth mindset is that I did eventually give up. I just wasn't smart enough and I didn't have the energy to put in the hard work to understand. It just \\\"wasn't going to be my thing.\\\" But after listening to these lessons, I will now truly have a growth mindset. Now I know that I can work hard to solve these problems and create those synapses I didn't have. Is it true that part of my reasoning for being \\\"dumb\\\" is that I wasn't taught it. Yes. But now I know, I can always create those synapses on my own.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

The highest grade I taught was Grade 6, but from Grade 2-6 you could see that each class is unique, each student learns at their own level, and need differentiation instruction. I find that students start doubting themselves in the later grades 4-6 (in my experience). In Grade 2 they are still wiling to try their best, and don't see failure as an option. In the older Grades failure starts setting in and ability grouping even starts to happen. _x0007_When I was teaching Grade 6, I would prepare a variety of different assignments varying in levels and abilities. I would allow students for the most part to choose the work they thought they could do, and by walking around the class I could tell where students were at in regards to ability. In some cases we do group work based on ability, which allowed the class to work at  their own pace. Sometimes we would do paired work, where ability didn't matter, but both students had to be prepared to show their work and understanding. In the end it is important to PROMOTE a POSITIVE attitude in the class, encourage discussion and encourage mistakes, and have a great rapport with your students."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

If all 10 coins were dimes, we would have $1.00 in coins, but there is 30 cents less than this.  That 30 cent difference is made up by trading in a nickel for a dime. (Remember, we need 10 coins in total.)  Trading one nickel for a dime is a 5 cent difference in coin value.  We need a 30 cent difference in coin value.  30/5 = 6.

Instead of me being the one to always sit down with the student to help them see their error, now I will allow the students to talk their way through the error.  This will, I hope, serve 2 purposes.  First we will be doing a lot more 'class talk' around what we understand about Math.  Second, knowing the enthusiasm of my students, they will all want a turn to be highlighted as the \\\"Math Learner of the Day\\\" and so mistakes will begin to be viewed in a positive light as they come with the prestige of being the center of attention at circle time.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

And honestly I think it's easier for me as a teacher because I teach in ECE so we're not limited by state testing or even by CCS (although we do have some state standards to uphold). So as a teacher, I wholeheartedly believe that grouping by ability does more harm than good._x0007__x0007_I carry this belief over into my parenting; however, on the parent side, I struggle because I see the damage that grouping is doing to my son and there is nothing I can do about it, other than continuing to build him up at home._x0007__x0007_We literally had this conversation last night when he brought home the \\I will be your child's math teacher this year\\\" letter. I asked him, \\\"Oh, who else is in your class?\\\" and he gave a few names, and then he looked at me and said \\\"I'm in the intermediate group - the average kids, not with the smart kids and I don't know why.\\\" Well, let's see, the letter said grouping was done based on past performance and state testing scores. Evan received an A in math last year and score in the Advanced category on his state tests. I told him I would go and advocate for him IF he wanted me to, because I also believe that a parent can push too much. He said no - he'd just try to convince his teacher to move his grouping by working hard. After he went to bed my older son, who had been through this school, said to me that no one gets moved from their group. Ever. And that just made me sad._x0007__x0007_So how do I convince an entire school district to do away with grouping by level, because it wouldn't be enough to change this one teacher's mind (she works in a team with the other 3 fifth grade teachers) because it is a district policy.

If I have a child with high(is this pc) ability then of course I would want my child to be with other high achievers. If my child was a low (is this pc) then I would still want my child to be with the high achievers hoping that some form of osmosis would cause some of the high learning to rub off on him or her. _x0007_As a parent I have always demanded (yes I was that parent) the same excellence in teaching from my  children's teachers as I demanded in learning from my children. My children were products of public schools and since I was a tax-paying parent (and cheap to boot) I made sure I followed my money. I encouraged teachers and helped teachers and I put in time with teachers to help my children achieve.  In the school system we had at the time we had what were called magnet schools. I did not like them then and still do not.  My oldest daughter attended the top magnet school in our city and earned a scholarship to Berea College. My daughter did everything there was to do to gain entry into the magnet school because she was a high learner, right? And because I do not support separating students into magnet schools I refused to assist her. My feelings are that all teachers are paid the same and all children should be taught the same. My youngest daughter did the same thing got entry and then failed out but she graduated with top honors (1 of 8) in her regular public school. She even taught (yes, taught) her 12th grade math class for the first semester because they had no teacher and used a Dummy book I bought for her because of my own weakness in math.

My first year teaching I was at a new school in an urban setting, where I taught 7th grade classes with extremely mixed abilities...from students who could had problems with basic arithmetic, mixed with kids who had private tutors, already knew all the curriculum, and wanted to learn advanced concepts and be pushed above their grade level. I provided challenge problems and extensions for these students, but many of them didn't want to work alone on these...they (and their parents) wanted the whole class to work at a more advanced level. I kept the lessons as conceptual as possible to keep it interesting and accessible to everyone and encouraged mistakes and questions, yet certain kids did not want to work with the most struggling students, and complained that much of the material they already knew (the curriculum at that time did cycle through topics that were repeated year after year, so this was somewhat true) but even though I tried to present these already seen topics in more depth, some of these kids just tuned out.

However it is surprising to see how hungry most of these kids are and the progress that can be made in a very short time.  They are able kids just not taught properly.

I am not willing to merely do review for test prep for 18 weeks, so we are starting the year with a unit about the brain. We will be exploring what happens in the brain when learning occurs, what conditions are optimal for learning, what we can each do to make our brains ready for learning, etc. In this unit, we will be discussing a lot of what we've talked about in this course--how synapses need to fire to make neurons grow, and that if that's not happening learning isn't really occurring. I think many of the students I will be working with are already disenfranchised with the \\test culture\\\" they've been working under most of their school careers. Many of them have determined that they are \\\"too dumb\\\" for \\\"school stuff.\\\" My hope is that this unit of exploration about the brain will help them to see that they're brains are all functional, all capable, and that they all have potential to improve their skills in any area. I'm intending this to be a rather motivational unit, and to then encourage them to explore what areas of learning they feel most interested in. I will then encourage them to pursue answers to some deep questions in those areas throughout the course. _x0007_So, my message to my students this fall will be: You have a brain. It is functional, capable, and full of potential. There are some very basic things you can do to make your brain grow. Make use of what you have and it will only get stronger!_x0007__x0007_(This post is in response to video session 3, part 10)\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Respond with only one of the options shown and label the following text: As I reflect on this course so far, Im most struck by how the fixed mindset hampers learning. So many students come to my class with this mindset (either Im not a math person, or Im really good in math, or Im good at calculating, but just cant solve those hard problems). Society, parents, teachers, and the students themselves reinforce this mindset, which will make changing it very difficult. The battle to change fixed mindsets must be fought parent by parent, student by student, classroom by classroom, school by school, and so on. Ability grouping (except in small doses) reinforces this mindset, but the fixed mindset probably is a main reason schools and teachers resort to ability grouping in the first place, which sets up a vicious circle. At my elementary school, we have heterogeneous regular math classes in which students of very different abilities work on the same lessons, sometimes as partners, sometimes individually. We have half-hour enrichment groups once or twice a week, during which the most advanced students work on challenging problems, while others work to improve basic skills, or solidify their grasp of concepts such as area and perimeter. I guess you could call it enrichment tracking.  I would love to incorporate more problems structured like the ones in Session 4.7. I examined and wrote about optimizing security cameras, which was given as a problem for grade 6, the lowest grade for which problems seem to be available. I would love to have a binder of such problems for the levels I will be teaching this year (grades 3 and 4). Optimizing security cameras was well thought out, tested, and structured for a growth-mindset classroom. I dont have anything like that to use with my students. In the MAP Classroom Challenges Guide for Teachers (#9 in the top 10 reasons for using the Classroom Challenges), I agree with the teacher who writes, I like the Classroom Challenges because theyre already created. Its hard to be a teacher, lesson designer, and evaluator, so the benefit to me is being able to use a lesson that is totally mapped outthe CCs are all rolled up into one neat package._x0007_This year for the first time, I will be teaching only math and science to students in grades three and four, which will allow me to focus on two subject areas, as opposed to teaching all subjects at one grade level. I hope this change, along with what Ive learned in this course, will enable me to focus more effective effort on encouraging growth mi"}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Since binary language, zeros and 1s, are so important in computer science, it is particularly important that people develop a sense of binary number solutions. For comparative purposes, you could show other traditional ways of depicting numbers, like egyptian figures, Roman numerals (try multiplying that way), and number systems based on 20s, like the Mayans. This helps convey a sense that different civilizations struggled with calculation in different ways, and that the way people do math says something about their culture. I noticed that no one in the video thought of the numjber pattern in threes, which is key for Pascal's Triangle; and that no one thought of using powers, such as 2 squared is 4, and 2 squared is 4, 4+4 is 8, plus 2 is 10. Nor did anyone think in terms of decimals, such as the first line is 0.4/1.0, etc. Having a fractional sense is important for scientific notation, as well as facility in logarithms, which would be essential for astronomy, earth sciences, and physics. These are some of the things that struck me as I watched the video."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Possibly, once all the ideas are shared, someone who didnt think of a particular grouping or counting method might prefer one of the others and feel it is easier- and now their eyes are open to that and they understand 10 in a new, multifaceted way. Like I read/heard elsewhere in this study the 10 was black and white, and now it is in color, or it was opaque, and now it is translucent. Ultimately, concerning the number 10, they now have a number sense- and due to the lengthy discussion, and thinking about it, they should retain and remember that new number sense._x0007__x0007_I think theyre important to do to gain number sense. I also can share a life experience in my previous career in which this type of grouping in different ways sped up my performance immensely. I was a vendor rep selling manufacturers products to retail stores, and I had to inventory my items in those stores once per month in each store, so every day for me. I started slow, counting every item. I learned to group in 5s and often 10s to be able to cut my time counting down hugely. Later in life working as a retail manager where inventory is only once a year, this also was a great benefit. This number sense truly impacts beyond the classroom and into life application- like was talked about earlier, everything comes down to addition."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

This rejection of logical possibilities restricts experience, closing down options. The converse suggestion here is that the remaining subgroup, white boys, do explore more possibilities open to them, in self perception at least. Why would one group choose to \\\"follow the rules\\\"?

Every school that I have been involved in has tracking systems monitoring the progress of students, incorporates minimum levels of expected progress over five years, one year, six weekly on which the teacher, department and school has to report back where targets have been met or otherwise. This alone indicates that they believe that students should make progress. The structure within mathematics for progress is based upon the 'ladder' which Paul Lockhart so eloquently  describes at the end of his 'Lament' essay. This is the working context that schools choose to work in, and so the growth mindset has to be linked to achieving the next level or grade. To remove this constraint in our present context may only improve the growth of  a few whilst marginalising the majority, whose motivational reality remains the 'grade'. As it stands in the UK, schools now have the choice to adapt the curriculum to their own needs; I would like to see mathematics departments reduce the ratio of objectives to time, in order to explore and develop the range of mathematical experiences for each objective, whilst still maintaining the 'reality of grades', to improve the learning of mathematics."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

I know what I have done in my classroom, however just because I do it doesn't mean that it is the best practice. Really in the end I think that it is about changing teacher mindset and convincing them that  using all of these strategies we've talked about such as using open tasks, questioning, collaboration and so on is the best way.  However this is such a challenging task as there are many skeptics out there who feel that none of this is new and we've tried it all so this isn't going to work, I'll just keep on doing what I'm doing.  One more thing that I have been told by an administrator was that we don't need anything new in the classroom we just need the kids to exercise their brains by using a program called brain safari....then they will do better - really??  I don't even think that brain safari has been tested outside of it's own company so how much do we really know.  I am sure it has some benefits but I just don't understand why we wouldn't want to take a more open ended approach to mathematics.   Anyhow, that is my rant, thanks for reading!"}], "max_tokens": 3}}

I was tracked in high school and I soon experienced its damaging effects. In year 7 I was put in level 1 maths (smart group). That class was horrible, the teacher was strict and spent more time mandating that students squish as much work onto their paper as possible than actual teaching - my anxiety levels went through the roof, so I asked to be transferred to another class. They instead put me into the average maths class. Later in the semester they made a 3rd class - the dumb class - and we all had to take a test to see which we should be put into...some kids, myself included, purposely did worse on the test to get into the super easy class - bludge class as we called it. And I was put into that class for a few weeks until I \\accidentally\\\" got 100% on the test and was moved back up to the average class. As a result of all this shuffling, I missed out on a lot of work since all three classes covered completely different content! I wasn't the only student who had these experiences. Unfortunately the school was only interested in teaching the kids in the smart classes (we were streamed in all classes, maths, English, Languages other than English, Studies of Society and Environment, Science and even sports class!) Tracking in sports class was the biggest joke. In the dumb sports class (level 3) we didn't play any sports, instead the teacher taught us how to properly apply make up and shave our legs!\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Algebraic formulae are methods of speeding up calculation, once the problem makes sense, and that also serve as road maps to solutions; using a formula usually requires only that a variable be replaced by a value, the work of determining the operational steps is identified in the formula's composition.

I was working with a group of  students on a project to determine supply amounts for a trip.  This particular student came up with a response that no one in the group agreed with.  I sensed it was because she had a reputation  that she wasn't good in math (the teacher had told me she would need extra help for math).  I don't remember the specifics of the problem, but I do remember that she was adding a column of 2 digit numbers. I verified (to myself) that her answer was correct and she could duplicate and explain her thinking.  No one else in the group could correctly add the column of numbers. The other students in the group told me that she couldn't have the correct answer.  We discussed different strategies and then someone suggested we use a calculator to see who had the correct answer. She beamed when the calculator agreed with her response.  I was sad to see that the students had labeled her in their own mind as someone who couldn't do math.

Substituting 2x -4 for C (our earlier representation for Charmaines card total) gives us T = 3/2(2x-4), and simplifies to T = 3x -6.

To prepare my 7th graders for this, last year I began to implement a learn on your own model (here's what you need to learn and here are the many resources to use to get there), work at your own pace, and use me as a coach.  I did away with direct teaching (for the most part) and became more of a coach and resource.  Students work together in groups, take assessments as they go before moving on to the next section.  I have to group the special ed students into two of my four classes so the special education teacher can be there to assist.  This creates a high concentration of \\lower achieving\\\" students in these classes and they generally have more behavior problems than my other two \\\"top\\\" classes.  Since there aren't enough special ed students to fill two whole classes, I have to mix in some of those students who would be considered in the middle, and I feel like they are being short changed having to put up with behaviors, lack of motivation, and thinking they are in with the dumb kids.

They did not try as they already knew their destiny, to remain in this group for the remainder of their school years. I remember days were they would hound me and stare at me until I gave them the answer. Those were few as I refused to allow them to stay stagnant at their current level. Teacher expectations were very low in this class and it was more a theme of shoot for the bottom of the class than anything. The work was challenging, but if I remember correctly, grading was not done in a way to promote learning, but instead cement in the students minds that they were low achievers. I don't know how the school could have gotten around having this class...intervention needed to start much earlier than 10th and 11th grade.

Parents are the number one reason children feel as though they may not be good at math._x0007_Teachers can play a role in much the same way parents do by offering too much support when a student can be better guided by allowing a little bit of struggle. Again, this can come back to enabling parents who get upset if they feel the teacher is not accommodating enough with their child._x0007_There are many other reasons but these were my top two."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

I had the opportunity to loop with my third graders to fourth grade. I use to think it was simply the students did have the foundational knowledge to learn knew materials. After teaching the middle of elementary (I taught 6th and first before moving to third) I have decided in my case it has to do with the pacing we are mandated to follow. _x0007__x0007_I work in a high risk district in which many of our schools are failing. A couple of high school have even been taken over by the state due to low reading and math scores on the statewide assessment. When I was in 6th grade I found it very frustrating with the huge gaps my students were coming to me with. The solution was to move to move to a lower grade... my principal moved me to first. I was able to spend alot of time giving my students a solid foundations in the basics but it was not what my students in 6th grade were missing. I was then moved to 3rd grade with the intention of looping with my students. In third grade is where I started to see huge gaps. It was at this time I decided it was due to the pacing I had to follow. We are told what to teach, when to teach it, how to teach it, and for how long. For example I was only allowed to teach multiplication for 3 days. That is a huge concept student must have a solid understanding of to build on. Division we spent a week on. I saw my students struggling and getting further and further behind but I was told to press on and they will eventually \\get it\\\". _x0007__x0007_Part of the pacing is an instructional cycle. We are told to push through the material then the district sends out about every 3-4 weeks that cover 3-5 big ideas. Once the data is scored we re mediate based on what the majority did the most poorly on all the while teaching knew concepts they need the previous concepts for. It is a vicious cycle that does not make sense to me. _x0007__x0007_Using the information I learned through all my moves I decided to look at the gaps my third graders came to me with (i.e. subtraction) and look at the second grade pacing guide. I was shocked they spent two days on the material. I was angered to see we are setting our kids up for failure at such a young age. If we are not giving them a solid foundation to build upon when they are young how on each to we expect them to be able to do higher level math?

They became frustrated and disruptive.  This is probably due to them having already been labelled 'low ability'.  The higher achieving students soon ran out of material and some would sit, after they had finished their exercises content to do nothing else.  The problem here seems to be the tasks that we have given the students - not open enough.  In order to begin to teach students in a mixed group you would need to do an immense amount of groundwork, giving them confidence, training them in how to be more independent and self-starting, preparing the kind of tasks during a lesson that ALL of them could do and still learn from._x0007__x0007_A second type of grouping we tried with lots more success was based on a pre-assessment.  This would be done several times during the year.  The pre-assessment would indicate a general aptitude (eg, with algebra, number, data or shape) and we would group the students based on this.  However, the students would still know whether they were in the top or bottom group so I imagine that this would promote a fixed mindset too._x0007__x0007_I want to have my students in mixed groups - the research indicates that this is the best thing to do after all.  The difficulty is HOW then do I teach them?  The ability range is so vast on occasions.  Perhaps you could also say that their learning styles are also far apart (I suspect that the 'high achievers' are more passive, are able to concentrate, do not mind sitting still, whereas the 'low achievers' are more active, want to be up out of their seats, chatting, playing, doing).

To register for each math class depends student & their parents, there is no qualification requested. Therefore a lot time in my grade 9/10 academic/university level course students only have grade 5/6 level of basic math skill. I find that it is very difficult for me to engage them, they feel bad and lost most of the time.

Our district wants to keep Geometry as an 8th grade class because that is what the high schools want to see. Students in middle school need to develop a sense of numbers, and be able to explore the whys of math. They need to enjoy what math is and what it can bring to their lives. Some students are not mature enough to handle the complexity of math and thus want to learn the \\\"tricks\\\" on how to do algebra._x0007__x0007_Pacing, CST's, pacing, high school pressures, large class sizes, ELD students, pacing are all contributing to the stress that math teachers face.

I had a conversation with my principal about having some of my students from last year repeat 6th grade math, but was told that they could not do that. They needed to start Pre-Algebra as 7th graders. I can bet that these same students will be \\\"repeating\\\" 7th grade Pre-Algebra as 8th graders.

We say you have to sit in a 3rd grade class for nine or so months before you can sit in a 4th grade one, and then repeat that pattern.  We also prefer to group kids in sizes of 20-40. I think smaller groups might be better. And most kids are sorted out socio-economically by the neighborhoods they live in, or by the private schools they attend. The students at Stanford have certainly been thoroughly sorted and grouped by test scores and performance. The professors as well.  Both groups could be viewed as comprising two large \\gifted\\\" tracks.  _x0007__x0007_I was thinking that perhaps everything would be a bit simpler if we simply sorted elementary teachers by ability and had math teachers teach math in elementary school.  Perhaps if we sorted it out this way, we would not be faced with so many kids in high school algebra who have never mastered elementary principles such as their multiplication facts.  And it seems like a no brainer, to have English majors teach reading and writing.  The writing skills of many high school students are embarrassingly meager as well.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

At grade 9 and 10 we have standard classes and one extended class. All students have multiple opportunities to extend and the MYP uses standards based assessment. I find this give a level playing field in a way. We are raising our expectations and revising our curriculum to give our students a better foundation and more options when they go into the Diploma Programme. I live in Singapore and see the tracking system in the local schools and it is very rigid and relies solely on test scores. The two systems are very different but the top tier of local students are very high scoring students when they get their diploma. That elides the masses who were tracked into the lowest levels and had no option but vocational college or straight into the work force as unskilled labor. Our goal as a school is to engage, enlighten and empower students. I think we are doing a pretty good job, but we could always do better. Most of our students go on to tertiary education and then into various careers. A lot of them come back to visit or give us updates on their successes. I would like to make our Math programme more robust and give our students a love of learning that they can take into any area of life.

I agree with you that I was tracked as gifted and bored if I wasn't in an advanced class.  What we really need is to unschool completely.  Schools should be completely open and optional, so the students can choose to enroll only in topics that they are actually wanting to learn and ready to learn.  Then all learning will take place quickly and efficiently and painlessly.  It's a matter of choice.  Of course, this doesn't mean that some people won't struggle with their learning.  A lot of people enjoy doing things that they aren't necessarily good at.  But if you enroll people of different ages and abilities in a class, like a knitting class, the more experienced and talented of the group will automatically become additional peer teachers who help the newcomers.  That is what real learning should always look like.  You got your grannies sitting next to the new mommies next to the teenagers.  Why should math be any different?"}], "max_tokens": 3}}

This has been identified as a significant issue time and time again in this country, but the steps taken to try and remediate the problem seem to be: Change the math! Call it New Math!

I managed to get through middle school math and up to geometry where by the grace of the UC system I hit the minimum required for application (though I actually went to private university so it hardly mattered) - and then I majored in a subject that required....MATH and lots of it, along with related cousins in science.

Needless to say, as a rising sophomore in a private college, she's doing everything she can to avoid taking math, and this is a college that actually does provide support for the traumatized._x0007__x0007_Finally, my son - the math kid. He's never worked very hard in math, at all. He has a natural ability to understand it and moves along with very little assistance. He took Algebra in 7th grade and told me he didn't learn a thing from that teacher and the California CST agreed with his assessment, giving him a score of \\below basic\\\" for the first time ever - usually he's rated \\\"advanced.\\\" Then he was passed along to geometry in 8th grade and did very well. Then in 9th grade he was put into an Algebra II/Trig class made up of frosh and sophomore students because he was \\\"advanced.\\\" I am curious to know why Alegbra II for a 9th grader isn't advanced enough? He failed almost upon entry into Alegbra II/Trig and was moved to a Alegbra II class with juniors and seniors.

I work in elementary schools and I tend to think finding good rich tasks with multiple entry points for all the possible \\abilities\\\" in a class can be challenging.

The school does not attempt to teach the students during this time. It is obvious that a fixed mindset school, develops negative vibes and negative learning opportunities for students to achieve the best that they can. _x0007_The blame on parents and students are damaging and fixing mindsets in students and parent.

Just like you need different exercises to build the different parts of your body you need a diversity of experiences to build connections in your brain. Nothing quite exercises the brain like thinking deeply about something, and when that something is  a mistake a lot depends on how you explain it to yourself. You can say \\I am stupid\\\" and understandably that does not help your brain grow. Alternatively,  you can decide you are going to explore what happened, particularly in the company of others.

Perhaps it is as one post in the discussion says: one sentence of praise amongst the negative messages is like a flower in the weeds. But I don't think that is enough to explain the phenomenon. I wonder if it has more to do with the fact that the critical feedback was valued differently by the students once that positive belief message was included alongside. Teachers are supposed to give feedback. It's their job. Perhaps the personal message impacted the way the critical feedback was seen by the students. Rather than just what the teacher is supposed to be doing, maybe the students now saw the feedback as more authentic. _x0007__x0007_I just had a thought about what if the teacher instead wrote \\I'm giving you this feedback because, frankly, this essay is crap.\\\" I guess such a comment would be incredibly harmful and would support any stereotype threat the student is affected by.

Then both partners come up in front of the class and must each explain one portion of how they solved the problem.  This helps both my learners to do the work and feel responsible.

When a student is going to a 2-year college, most have yet to enroll before the year is up, must figure out how to pay for courses, and many use the word probably in their response (as in, Ill probably go to PCC in the fall).  _x0007__x0007_In these conversations, Ive found that the general 2-year college student is not as committed to the idea of taking the next step as their 4-year counterpart.  I ask what drives them or what is their path of interest, and most 2-year students are unsure and say they are going to figure it out when they get there whereas the 4-year student has determined the general field they will pursue at least to get started.  Contributing factors that I always wonder about after these conversations include how much guidance a student has received from a parent/mentor/counselor, the students ability to make decisions and have confidence in those decisions (I could not make these decisions myself but had parent support), and if there is the presence of a positive peer group that has influence over their lifes direction.

Okay, some of them weren't ready, but it was so much better.  The low students didn't have a stigma.  They were treated as equals.  The higher students would help the low students.  The low students weren't babied, and several of them rose to the challenge._x0007__x0007_Since then I have tried to stop the tracking.  I have mixed it up a little bit, but having advanced 6th graders mixed with 7th graders, and advanced 7th graders mixed with 8th graders, which worked well.  Unfortunately, my old school decided to not allow classes with mixed grades, which meant everything would be tracked.  I tried to keep the 6th graders from being tracked.  We emphasized it was more Common Core related, and the district agreed, however, they caved due to parent pressure and they ended up with a 6th grade advanced class, or they left the school.  _x0007__x0007_Now I will be teaching a 6th grade advanced class, how will I keep them from getting a fixed mindset!?"}], "max_tokens": 3}}

I  try to use whole class strategies that help students at all levels access the content, or allow students to support one another as they access the content from various levels of understanding.  However, for intervention the students are grouped by ability for about 30 minutes so that specific skills (or areas of needed intervention) can be targeted.  I see this as targeted instruction that can support students at various levels.  Also, I teach whole class reading, but then break into groups to have students read different books at their reading level.  This is a strategy that I learned as part of my reading training.  Students need to be reading at their reading level in order to develop as readers. I wonder if RTI strategies such as these would be included in the definition of ability grouping that was discussed in the video?

Would you mind giving me some more insight as to where that feeling comes from?  I ask because I teach 9th graders Algebra, and there are students in our school who take Algebra in the 8th grade and then Geometry in the 9th. My Algebra freshmen sometimes come to me and ask me about taking Geometry in Summer School or doubling up on math classes as sophomores taking both Geometry and Algebra 2 simultaneously.  When I ask them why, they tell me that they are behind and won't be able to take Calculus their senior year.  Usually when I question them further, they can't even tell me why they think they need Calculus before going to college.  So is it less that they are truly \\\"behind\\\" and more that they see someone getting \\\"ahead\\\" of them?  Where are they getting this idea that it is a competition?

For example the fastest speed an untrained subject may be able to run at is 12km, while a trained subject max speed may be 18km/h.  When they are both running at the same speed for example 10km/h the trained and untrained athlete may be consuming around the same quantity of oxygen.  (The trained athlete will consume slightly less as per the diagram).  The key point is that training allows the trained subject to run faster or do more work than the untrained subject._x0007_Hope this helps,_x0007_<nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>"}], "max_tokens": 3}}
