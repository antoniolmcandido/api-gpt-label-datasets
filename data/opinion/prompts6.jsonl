Is it okay to break conventions sometimes if that would convey the message more effectively? Another question is: Is it now okay to use contractions in formal writing?

Climate modelling also indicates that the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) reduces (increases) during weaker (stronger) solar activity (Cubasch et al., 1997; Waple et al., 2002), contributing to negative Greenland temperature responses to solar variability (Kobashi et al., 2013).\\\"_x0007__x0007_If only this were the only part of this article like this.

This is a  non-credit course.  There is no verification process to establish the one receiving a certificate is the one who completed the assignments.  Most complain about how their grades were unjustified--the goal is to learn to write better, not to get a 3 rather than a 2.  If a reviewer is unfamiliar with content, wouldn't it be honest to admit that?  There is no mechanism for a reviewer to omit a grade if content is beyond them.  Also, it is obviously commendable that everyone is working hard, but effort does not necessarily equate to high marks.  In the old days there were grades for effort distinct from grades for content knowledge.  There is no such thing here.  If a reviewer can't suggest any  improvements for any reason, it'd be better not to make some up."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

And that means that we should write for the average reader, lay public. I'm not from the hard sciences, so I had a hard time understanding 3 of the essays I reviewed. One was really so technical. I tried my best to grade fairly, but made comments and suggestions to rewrite the essay for the average reader. Another one was from molecular biology, but her/his essay was fun to read and I was able to understand everything. It was really good; I gave it 15 points. I did not have to change anything there, or make suggestions. I wish now I copied it (for myself) so I can make it a model of clear writing in the sciences. So, it is really difficult to express complicated information using simple language, but it can be done."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

On October 18, 2013 New York Times health and science reporter Gina Kolata wrote about Aronowitzs articles and the underlying study in Decades Later, Condemnation For a Skid Row Cancer Study.  The study subjects--skid row alcoholics--were offered room and board for a short stay if they allowed the researchers to perform prostate biopsies in a very interesting part of their anatomy. (Kolata, A3)  If found to be positive, those subjects were provided free medical followup.  Weaving together interviews, assessments by medical historians and analyses of the original Aronowitz articles, Kolata wrote a devastating critique of the project and practically all involved in it.  This essay will scrutinize her critique and will examine how she dealt with the more consequential issues implicit in the study and others like it. [Fn. not pasteable from Word.]_x0007__x0007_Perry Hudson, M.D. was a young medical researcher at Columbia University in the 1950s.  He wanted to show that prostate cancer could be detected early on, treated and cured, and as Kolata notes a laudable goal (Kolata, A3), except that Hudson chose skid row alcoholics to be his subjects and his methodology incorporated invasive biopsiesa scenario made worse by Hudsons lack of full disclosure.  He picked men from Bowery flophouses , homeless, penniless men who were often mentally ill alcoholics unlikely to understand what was involved; and who, even if aware, were powerless to do much about it.  Administrators ensured the volunteers continued attendance in the program by withholding their meal tickets.  (Kolata)_x0007__x0007_Hudson screened subjects via invasive biopsy; surgical incision was the accepted  protocol then.  At that time, prostate cancer was more often than not a death sentence.  If detected, it was discovered late, after metastasis, and usually fatal.   Hudson warned only of possible infection, when other serious complications often did occur:  including rectal complications, impotency and diminished sexual functioning.

Most of the other edits, while innocuous, did not improve the text, merely changed the order randomly.

Although I am sure most of the peers take this task seriously, I might get three peers like the problematic one..._x0007__x0007_So, for the future, I suggest to WITS Course Team to add an option for flaging peers in cases like this. I am aware there are several thousand registered users and you are not able to check each complaint like mine. But you could maybe implement some kind of filtering based on your peer review system, which functions really well: if some peer is flagged as \\irresponsible\\\", three peers might judge if it is true or not.

The distant blaring honks and motor sounds of the chaotic Delhi traffic gradually faded further as she continued to look ahead at the 17th century astronomical instruments trying to decipher the complexity of the concrete observatory tools. _x0007__x0007_This was Mayas second visit to Delhi from her village Jharsa in Gurgaon located on the outskirts of Delhi. She was visiting her mothers brother Gopal who was a lower division clerk in the state government. Although Gopals position in the government was among the lowest in the government machinery, he was a respected man in his village by virtue of his employment. Employment in the government was aspirational amongst the youth in Jharsa where he also grew up as a child. A government employment not only ensured secure employment and a regular monthly income but also a state pension on retirement.

Maya who had never encountered a foreigner in the past was excited to have had this opportunity and in turn tried hard to impress Lisa with her knowledge of elementary school mathematics. Back at school, Maya was an average student but she had developed the ability recall her lessons from memory.   She had been memorizing multiplication tables, equations and formulas.

However, since neuroimaging techniques like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) only allow correlative statements, the causal contribution of the aPFC to deceptive behavior remains elusive._x0007__x0007__x0007_<nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> et al. (2010) showed for the first time that inhibiting the activity of the aPFC by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) alters deceptive behavior. In their study healthy subjects participated in a mock crime and a subsequent interrogation with the Guilty Knowledge Test. During the interrogation subjects received in randomized order either cathodal tDCS to inhibit their anterior prefrontal cortex or sham tDCS as placebo control._x0007__x0007__x0007_Remarkably, inhibiting the aPFC did not lead to an impairment of deceptive behavior but rather to a significant improvement. This effect was shown by faster reaction times in telling lies, but not in telling the truth, a decrease in sympathetic activity and feelings of guilt while deceiving the interrogator and a significantly higher lying quotient reflecting skillful lying._x0007__x0007__x0007_Their findings suggest that inhibiting the aPFC reduces the moral conflict during deception, presumably evoked by performing a self-perce"}], "max_tokens": 3}}

But, Hop have different structures, the research group demonstrated some exceptions, the absence of DP<zipRedac> domain in Glycine max and DP2 in Arabidopsis thaliana indicating redundant functions, essential for some species but not for all in vivo protein activities. _x0007__x0007_Hop gene contains six introns but, how genomic introns were formed? Sine a long time, two theories have existed: Intron-early theory, present at the beginning of life; and Intron-late, inserted much later in an uninterrupted coding sequence (Da Lage et al., 2<zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac>). Hop supports the first, it has an intron phase distribution with excess of phase <zipRedac>, demonstrating that it have been inserted at early stage of its evolution. Which would explain the origin of three TPR domains in these species by recombination. This theory allowed to hypothesize the presence of hypervariable regions (DP<zipRedac> and 2 domains) without relation with some protein functions (Hernndez Torres et al., 2<zipRedac><zipRedac>9)._x0007__x0007_In conclusion, Hop arose from successive duplication of initial module which contained one TPR-DP domain.

It served as a place to publish your work that might not be cutting edge or the results might not have a significant impact on the field, but it was still very sound work and offered a unique contribution.

In addition to the ample amount of computer glitches causing students to get 0's and 1's on their essays, I believe the grading system is very unfair. I received a perfect score from one reviewer, a very low score from another (which I'm assuming is due to computer error considering my reviewer stated that they enjoyed my essay in the comment section), and a low score without any feedback whatsoever from my final reviewer. This means my final grade will be low, despite 2 reviewers actually liking my essay; my third reviewer was apparently just lazy and grumpy. I spent hours carefully reviewing 4 essays, revising them, and providing ample feedback. I feel like I'm putting in a lot of work to help others but I'm not getting any feedback on my own writing (which I thought was a major component of the course). I'm sure other students feel the same way. Additionally, questions and concerns about the course software and computer problems are not being addressed in a timely fashion."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

One of the medical ones was brilliant and very easy to understand while still keeping the scientific nature required._x0007__x0007_My essay was written so that anyone could understand it, and I received high marks because of this. I think many other people need more practice at writing for the lay-person. It is a very useful skill to have - my first (and only so far) published work was written for a journal that is aimed at anyone from the weather enthusiast to professors in the field. It was a big challenge to write for this audience, but it has taught me a lot._x0007__x0007_I did struggle on some of the earlier editing exercises because I had very little understanding of what the author of the sentence was trying to say, so I often wasn't sure of what words I could remove without changing the meaning."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

From the guides, 0 points (no score) means blank or incomplete essay, which is not the case. The assay is complete and even though it's not perfect I think it's not fair to get three \\\"0\\\" -specially when the other 2 reviewers are saying it is pretty good. I think that the last one didn't pay much attention when grading it and just selected the first thing that he saw._x0007_I would like to know if there is any way to report these cases so that they are not taken into account, because I don't think they're serious._x0007_Many thanks and thanks for organizing this great course._x0007_<nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

I enjoyed your interview. _x0007__x0007_I've worked in energy industry for about 20 years. My colleagues,scientists and engineers, struggle with concise, clear, and interesting writing. I remember writing a group paper with industry professionals who had more experience and published papers than me. I learned early in my career (actually my first technical writing course in college) to practice good writing - clear, concise, and correct. When editing our paper, I explained to a senior colleague why we should avoid passive voice when possible. He didn't agree. He commented that he didn't believe in that - active voice. Very old school attitude. And he wasn't the only one with attitude.  _x0007__x0007_Now, more papers in our industry are interesting and easy-to-read. Industry style guides, like Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) and American Petroleum Industry (API), encourage the active voice, as well as most of the good writing techniques discussed in this course."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Over two essays I have received two blank reviews and one that was very poor quality - largely grammatically incorrect and misspelled corrections that changed the meaning of sentences or rendered them nonsensical. _x0007__x0007_I propose that after submitting peer reviews, the reviewer cannot see their own grades until the reviews they have given are verified (and they have to verify a number of other peer reviews). All this would involve is having a quick skim of the comments and ticking a box to say \\this review is fair\\\". The additional workload would be minimal. A fair review would be one in which the grades in each section are justified in the reviewers comments - the checker does not necessarily have to agree with the score, they are really just making sure that the essay has been actually been reviewed and the grade is consistent with the comments. If comments are absent, nonsensical, or inconsistent with the grades (due to the reset problem), the review would be rejected and the reviewer would have to review another essay in order to progress. It would not be possible to see your own essay results until you have given four verified reviews._x0007__x0007_Thoughts?\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

As this educational system is in the toddler stage (I think it is beyond infancy) there will still be bugs in the computer systems, as well as in the individual programs. I find the range of participants is similar to the people in life-some are valuable and very helpful, some are not. And so, as in life, I will accept the help and benefit of those who provide it, and will not pay so much attention to those who offer little or no contribution. _x0007__x0007_Please consider the type of class you are taking-this is a writing class where someone has to evaluate your essay and entries, so having a peer review system built in is a great answer to the problem of a handful of volunteers trying to assess so many papers. Other classes have only computerized testing, and thus fewer problems will arise. For this specific class, though, I am also considerate of the possibility that for those doing peer review, this may be their first experience at critiquing another person's work and they may not be entirely comfortable with having to offer criticism, whether good or bad. _x0007__x0007_I enjoy taking MOOCS because I get to interact with, and learn from, so many different people. To me, there is value in the experience itself. _x0007__x0007_And Micahela is right-if an individual wants direct instruction, those sorts of classes are available for a cost.

That way veterinarians are not having to try to edit materials for neuo-molecular biologist and those that have no interest in medicine do not have to edit medical based materials. They could make the students pick the groups by filling out a survey at the beginning of class.  If the groups were not large enough then they could combine some of them to make grading easier and more of a relevant group effort."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

It is important for MOOCs to sustain, and it would be shame if they have to close down because costs aren't met. Some MOOCs offer the courses for free but charge a fee for the certificate. _x0007__x0007_(Sadly, regardless of the good intentions, MOOCs will not be accessible to \\everyone\\\" or \\\"all\\\" in the present.

For example in assignemnt 1 i recieved an essay on Dolphins when the suggestions where to write about a published paper or a person in science. The current metrics for measuring the output of the assignments has to incorporate a item where the instructions are met, in a similar way than in plagiarism (e.g. being able to flag a essay that does not meet the instructions). Accomplishing the instructions for authors is a vital aspect of the publication process so I would suggest that a metric for this aspect is incorporated in the current way of grading.

MOOCs are ideal for bridge courses and prerequisites necessary for a taking a regular university course. This way, the teaching staff can focus on higher value courses and research._x0007__x0007_Still, it isn't fair on my part to compare MOOCs with regular classroom courses. Distance education using postal services has been around in many countries for several decades. Two decades ago, interactive livecast of classrooms to satellite campuses were popular in the US. This approach then carried over to the Internet in the mid 90s. Many of these \\remote\\\" courses were also recognized, and contributed to a degree. Most courses had a fee. MOOCs are an extension of that. They have come a long way since 1999 when MIT placed its entire academic courseware online at ocw.mit.edu, totally free of cost. They changed the game. Last year MIT and Stanford teamed up and invested to launch Venture Lab (now NovoEd). There are some amazing MOOCs there, two of which I am currently taking.

This post is NOT to complain for the grades (that are quite high, so I'm really satisfied with them), but to open a discussion about the usefulness of the grading systems as it is at the moment._x0007__x0007_For writing assignment 2, I submitted the introduction of a paper I am drafting. The peer grading were the following:_x0007__x0007_GRADER 1 --> 15/15, no comments or corrections on the essay _x0007__x0007_GRADER 2 --> 13/15, no comments or corrections on the essay _x0007__x0007_GRADER 3 --> 13/15, no comments or corrections on the essay _x0007__x0007_I decided to resubmit the same essay for writing assignment 3 (in the hope of receiving some usefull suggestions/comments); I edited it a little bit, but I couldn't do much becasue I had no feedback from the first 3 reviewers. Some minutes ago I got the peer grading for assignament 3:_x0007__x0007_GRADER 4 --> 15/15, no comments or corrections on the essay _x0007__x0007_GRADER 5 --> 13/15, no comments or corrections on the essay _x0007__x0007_GRADER 6 --> 10/15, no comments or corrections on the essay (and this one really made me angry: he/she graded the essay as boring, non-compelling, confused, inconsistent, full of clutter...and left NO comment ?!?!?!?!?)_x0007__x0007_So, the point is that my essay was reviewer by 6 different people, got grades ranging from 10 (indicating a rather poor quality of writing) to 15 (perfection), and NO ONE gave me a single suggestion about how to improve it. So, in the end, I don't know the real quality of my writing, and I've got no feedback about how to improve it. This makes me think that the peer-grading system in this course is completely useless and is not a learning tool. What I think is that some (the majority of?) reviewers doesn't even care to read the essay, they just click on the scores - although I must admit that I've been lucky: at least my reviewers were just lazy, but didn't gave me dramatically low scores! _x0007__x0007_But how canwe learn how to improve our writing skills from this experience?"}], "max_tokens": 3}}

My lowest score on essay 3 was 10 - this reviewer added a 3 work edit and commented 'too much words'! If this was really their only problem with my work  then surely more effort should have been put in to providing revisions. _x0007__x0007_People have a tendency to want to get their own results and know this can only happen if they get through the reviews so they want it over and done with. We are therefore reliant on the integrity of participants - I don't know the answer to making everyone do it correctly but perhaps looking at alternative ways might help - this time I edited externally and pasted my reviewed version into the system (downside- no standard mark-ups but comments for each of the participants, a virtual re-write for 2 and substantial edits throughout all 4 and avoiding all the system bugs meant it took much less time and no marking changes!). _x0007__x0007_It would be nice if there were some type of checking system that related score to editing - a score of 15 requiring none or little but more and more edits required as the score reduces (a percentage of the initial word count perhaps?). I realise this is probably way beyond this type of system and won't eliminate 'ksudhgra;ksdbv;aergu' type edits but so many people have been frustrated by this process that I believe it needs to be addressed before the course is offered again. A reviewer feedback system would be useful too even if it was as simple as - I find this review helpful/unhelpful/unnecessary -at least then, the reviewer gets some feedback on their work and the reviewee (is that a word?) may feel better by being able to comment directly._x0007__x0007_Although of concern to all, those who are genuinely at the lower end of the ability range need the most feedback on this type of task in order that they can improve their writing skills. Well done on your good scores, it appears that you are applying the principles the course suggested so probably required little editing."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

I am 52 and trained as an engineer (state college), and have always been a long-time life-learner. I am a practical person (I clean my own gutter on my house, and help with the laundry)._x0007__x0007_Thank you Professor <redacted>, and staff. I finished your Stat-in-med course last month... it was difficult to keep up with the pace and juggle work, family, life. But I really enjoyed it. _x0007__x0007_Now for the other shoe... I feel betrayed by the peer review system. In my comments section in the end survey I noted that I feel the peer review is an excellent tool for the reviewer--not the reviewed. I commented that the peer review ought to be de-emphasized vis-a-vis \\grade\\\". 50% of the course grade is a heavy price to pay. Since the reviewer is not a trained editor, much of the resulting grades are 'random'. Editing our peer's work was a unique experience and I feel that many of the students here tried to be as objective and honest as possible. Except for one. I received a review of my intro-rewrite for #3. In the review I was referred to in a derogatory fashion(un-subtle form of bullying). Furthermore this reviewer proceeded to remark about trivial changes to my paper and gave me an 8! None of my submissions were ever below 10 (that I recall), even with the software bugs that caused so many zeroes._x0007__x0007_I doubt that much can be done about the bully: some people just weren't raised right. But I do hope you reconsider, you know, during the Monday-morning meetings... adjustments to the weight of the grade offered to the peer review. I re-iterate I really enjoyed the art of editing, and was probably an easy grader-- the peer-review pedagogy is slanted to the reviewer's advantage.  _x0007__x0007_Well, that's all. Thanks again, I will not give up on the MOOC idea, and I will continue to search for more Stanford classes, even though I root for Cal!

I've learned a lot, and it's helped me feel more self-assertive when making suggestions to my clients. All very good and valuable, and much appreciated. Thanks to Kristin and everybody behind the course. _x0007__x0007_I'd like to say though, that after having scored 89%, I'm thinking that if I hadn't been honest during the self-assessment quizzes, I would have ended up with 90% --because there was 1 question that I marked against myself. _x0007__x0007_Further, I feel that many of my essays were marked unfairly. They were given extremely low marks, which brought my middle-score down substantially. I am a professional journalist and have been editing/revising academic texts for 7 years. I've been published as a primary author in BMJ, Lancet and the WHO Bulletin. I know what bad writing is (including my own, when I'm too pressed for time to improve it), and my essays did not deserve 8's and 10's. _x0007__x0007_So, I feel that the peer assessments --while probably necessary for this wonderful, free, and packed course-- can be unfair because of ... well, because there are a lot of haters out there. Thus, it seems the only way to compensate for that unfairness is to boost your score during self-assessment. _x0007__x0007_I'm sorry I can't offer any practical suggestions for improving a necessary system.

That says basically only <zipRedac>5 out of <zipRedac>0000 per year will have lower risks of developing a breast cancer. The question she is going to ask am I going to be among those <zipRedac>5 or not ? Is this a lot ? Am I going to develop cancer? What's happening to woman of my age? To me, it sounds more informative to describe to a woman that she is potentially a person at risk (add some numbers, the risk is X person/ Y people) meaning she may or may not develop a cancer, BUT if she takes that drug, her risk of developing cancer will be halved. This is more concrete at the individual level. The key info is the risk reduction by 50% not some numbers people cannot refer to. This is my opinion. Any other takers? Profs / instructors ?

I was reading some of the comments/posts on Essay 3, that say that if Essay 3 is an improved version of a previously submitted essay, at least 5% of it must be different from the previous version, only then will it be peer-reviewed and graded. So my question to you moderators/co-ordinators is- Were we supposed to copy and paste both the previous version and the improved version in the box where we submitted essay 3?? How will the reviewers know what changes were made, and how to grade the new essay? More importantly, I did not see instructions to submit both the previous version and the new improved version of the essays, so I only pasted my improved version as Essay 3. Will it get peer-reviewed and graded??_x0007_Also, some people taking this course posted on this board that they did not receive any new scores after submitting a new essay 3. What do we do? _x0007_Please clarify this for all of us and tell us if there are any changes we need to make in time so we can still receive scores and hopefully improve our overall grades._x0007_Thank you."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

A response rate of 65% was imputed for women participants based on the unweighted data and the gender distribution of the Australian population.

I logged on about an hour ago (1300hr AEDT on 23 Nov in Australia), thinking I still had an hour to finish it before 7pm on 22 Nov in the Pacific timezone, but then saw the email saying the \\The course has now closed!\\\". I hadn't noticed the change to UTC prior to this (I had just assumed the the course would keep to a consistent time zone for the duration of the course) and all I had left to do was the final exam - so I did it anyway, but it did not save my answers. But I selected my answers and clicked 'Show Answers' afterwards, and i got 20/21 correct answers. Is it possible to still receive a statement of accomplishment that includes the final exam results?_x0007__x0007_Thank you,_x0007_Bo\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

When learning from the course, some of the rules were very rare to me; I thought that they could be appropriate to medical science but not to evolutionary ecology or biological science in general. Nothing of the sort: I realized that the papers I liked the most, were written in such a similar way, close to these course recommendations._x0007__x0007_I think that, to use the active voice or to use verbs instead of nouns (maybe there are other rules more subjective), are recommendations that do not follow a kind of fashion. I really believe that these options appeal to our brain, to how our brain decodifies the language. I am not an expertise in this field, maybe someone else may explain it or correct me._x0007__x0007_ Of course, from my point of view, our culture influences also on how our brain works the language.

Anaphylaxis can lead to a type of shock (lack of oxygen on a tissue level associated with low blood pressure). In fact, low blood pressure is part of the diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis. However, low blood pressure is not required to make the diagnosis! Therefore, physicians sometimes use the diagnosis of anaphylactic shock to describe a patient who has hypotension from an allergen. Whereas, anaphylaxis is used to describe an allergic reaction that meets certain criteria but does not include low blood pressure (e.g. rash + respiratory compromise; rash + gastrointestinal compromise). _x0007__x0007_Hope this helps!"}], "max_tokens": 3}}

As Dr. <redacted> discussed in the video, the data we are dealing with (from the larger sample) is right skewed. If you compare the mean from the 2009 smaller sample and the mean from the 2012 larger sample, you might want to jump to the conclusion that the lead in lipstick increased from 2009 to 2012. This is not correct. We are actually detecting a bigger maximum in the larger sample because we have a right skewed distribution. In the sample of 22, you are less likely to find the extreme values. When you sample more, you are going to see more of the infrequent extreme events. _x0007__x0007_When calculating the mean, you take all the numbers in the dataset, add them together, and divide them by the number of entries. Since your are adding all the numbers, extreme values can influence the mean. With the median, which is the 50% point in the data, infrequent extreme values generally will not impact the value. In this example, we are interested in a value that is representative of our entire sample. The mean is not the best choice because it is influenced by outliers. _x0007__x0007_Hope this helps!_x0007__x0007_Josh"}], "max_tokens": 3}}

There is actually already a discussion \\Unit 1 Module 4 Quiz\\\" if you are interested in joining that group._x0007__x0007_It sounds like you are understanding the principle! Yes, it does depend on how exactly the values fall. So what happens if you have a distribution with a significant left skew and a single high-value outlier? If the single right outlier is very extreme, it may be the case that you no longer have a left skew. It could also be a miscoded data point (a mistake measurement). If there is one right outlier (that may not be as extreme), it will not have an impact on the median. If it still has a significant left skew (even with the one outlier to the right), what effect will having a left tail have on the mean?...in what direction will it pull the mean? _x0007__x0007_Since in the example you give, you say that there is still a significant left skew, even with the outlier on the right, it should still pull the mean in the direction that you expect (not trying to completely give away the quiz solution!) _x0007__x0007_Hope this helps!\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

To calculate the standard deviation you first have to know what the mean is. So when you find the mean you should get -18.5._x0007_The standard deviation means you have to look at how far away each sample is away from the mean. One way to do this by hand is to organize it in a table and subtract the mean from each x-value. Then you can find the squared deviations, the sum of the squared deviations, divide by (n-1), and then take the square root. I have attached a picture to show the work by hand. It is most likely just a computational error. There are many other ways to calculate this in a calculator, Excel spreadsheet, or other statistical software. Since this is such a small sample, it is a nice one to show by hand how it truly is calculated._x0007__x0007_![enter image description here][1]_x0007__x0007__x0007_  [1]: https://edx-west-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1<phoneRedac><phoneRedac>61.jpg"}], "max_tokens": 3}}

From a clinical perspective the problem with randomised trials is that the people designing the trials usually want a fairly homogenous group of paricipants, often people with co-morbidities are excluded and children and pregnant women are almost always excluded. This means that when you're sitting in your clinic room trying to decide whether a particular treatment might be good for the patient sitting in front of you the trial evidence may well not be readily applicable to them i.e. if they're of a different gender, age, ethnicity etc from the participants in the trial. _x0007__x0007_Well conducted randomised controlled trials are the gold standard for trial design but from an evidence based medicine perspective a well conducted systematic review and meta-analysis (pooling of the evidence and potentially the statistics) of good quality randomised trials will give you more reliable evidence."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Respond with only one of the options shown and label the following text: Hello_x0007__x0007_Good questions!_x0007__x0007_So it seems like you are confusing cumulative incidence and incidence rate. _x0007__x0007_CI is a proportion, it is the (# people who develop an outcome / # of people initially at risk). With the CI all people are followed for the same amount of time. _x0007_For example, say you had 40 people in a STATS class and a 1-year period. 14 of these students developed pneumonia. The 1-year cumulative incidence of pneumonia (14/40) or (14/40)*100 = 35 per 100 students. A CI value has no units and the denominator is based on all people who are at risk at risk in the population. It assumes that all people are followed for the same amount of time (in this case a year), and that the population is closed (no people going in or out). _x0007__x0007_Incidence rate (also called incidence density) = # of incident cases / Amount of person time at risk. The best way to think of it is as the occurrence of new cases (of a particular outcome) that arise during a certain amount of person-time of observation. The numerator for CI and incidence rate are exactly the same. The difference is that incidence rate is a true rate because it includes time. _x0007__x0007_In order to understand incidence rate, one needs to talk about person-time. Person-time is only counted up until a person is diagnosed with the outcome of interest. For incidence rate, there is no assumption that everyone is followed for the same amount of time. People can exit and enter the population. So say a person is in a study for 6 months, without getting the outcome, and then drops out - they contribute 6 months to the person time of observation in the candidate population. Say a person is in the study for 12 months, without getting the outcome, and then dies - they contribute 12 months to the person time of observation in the candidate population. Say a person is in the study for 6 months and then gets diagnosed with the outcome of interest - they contribute 6 months to the person time of observation in the candidate population. If these were the only 3 people in the study, the incidence rate would be 1 / 2person-years. The numerator is 1 because 1 person had the outcome and the denominator of the incidence rate is the sum of all the person-times from each member in the candidate population (the population at risk)."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

How should that guide us when choosing a statistical test ?_x0007__x0007_For instance, in question 3, suppose that we only considered blood pressure, I would have gone for a paired t-test with the following arguments:_x0007__x0007_ - Continuous variable _x0007_ - Correlated observations (one group of people before/after exposure)_x0007_ - Normality assumption holds_x0007__x0007_But since we are also measuring heart rate, I wonder how that affects our study. Should we perform a paired t-test with some adjustment for repeated measures (e.g. Bonferroni...)? _x0007__x0007__x0007_Also, I have a slight doubt on the information needed to performe the test: module 1 in unit 7 states that we should calculate the change for each person, then calculate the average change.

Yes, beta coefficients can be a huge source of confusion when authors/readers don't pay close enough attention to the units. Beta coefficients are entirely unit-dependent, so you have to think very carefully about the units. However, they do have some advantages over correlation coefficients. We often want to know how much does Y increase or decrease on average for a 1-unit increase in X. The correlation coefficient doesn't tell us this. A good alternative, for continuous variables, is to standardize them by turning them into Z-scores (Standard Deviation units). If you put standardized variables into the linear regression model, then the beta coefficients will be in SD-Y/SD-X units. So for example, a beta coefficient of 0.25 tells that a 1-SD increase in X correlates to a 0.25-SD increase in Y. It's easier to compare across different predictors if they are all in SD units."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Just wanted to make sure this can be done with either value or should you always use the rate difference?  And if someone reports the NNT, do you assume this was calculated as 1/rate difference vs. 1/risk difference?_x0007__x0007_-It seems to me that prevalence and cumulative risk are the same except that prevalence implies you are doing a cross sectional study and cumulative risk implies that you are doing a cohort study.  So if Im doing a cross sectional study, I would report prevalence, not cumulative risk.  If I do a cohort study, I would never report prevalence but instead cumulative risk.  Am I missing anything here?_x0007__x0007_-Considering the rofecoxib vs. naproxen study: is it correct to say we dont really know whether naproxen is more protective than rofecoxib regarding MIs or whether rofecoxib (and/or naproxen) is linked to MIs?  It seems to me that the only way you would know which statement is correct is if you had a placebo group who did not receive either drug. Then you would compare the rate of events in all these groups.  _x0007__x0007_-Well-conducted randomized controlled trials are considered the criterion standard for establishing a causal link between a risk factor and an outcome.  Regarding this statement from the paper on study designs, I dont really understand this.  I would think that a cohort study would be the criterion standard for this and RCTs would be the criterion standard for a causal link between an intervention and an outcome.  _x0007__x0007_Thanks for clarifying.

So in the \\\"fracture\\\" top row, 60% are >55. To solve for this you take the row total = 30 and multiply it by .60 (for the 60%). This gives you 18. With a row total of 30 and the \\\"Fraction/>55\\\" intersection of 18, you can solve for the \\\"Fraction/=<55\\\" intersection. _x0007__x0007_You are then told that 60% of the patients without a fraction are older than 55.

Let me try explaining both of your questions with one example!_x0007__x0007_As you may have seen in the lectures, a distribution is skewed if one tail is longer than the other (there is a lack of symmetry). With a right skew (also called positive), the bulk (or mass) of the data is on the left and there is a tail extending to the right with extreme values. (Go to google and look a pictures of right skewed data). Do you remember learning about odds ratios? You may remember that Dr. <redacted> mentioned that the sampling distribution of the OR is skewed to the right? If you think about how ORs are calculated and what they mean, it is clear that you cannot have negative values. (A negative OR does not make any sense!). With a limit at the lower end (zero is the limit since it cannot be negative), you get a skewed distribution. An OR can be any positive value from 0 to infinity. With large values on the right...you have right skewed data. So what can you do to ***Transform*** this data to deal with the fact that the distribution is skewed? _x0007__x0007_What happens when you take the log of a negative number (try it on a calculator)?_x0007_What happens when you take the log of a decimal <1 (for example try 0.5 on a calculator)?_x0007_What happens when you take the log of 1? (try it on a calculator)?_x0007_WHat happens when you take the log of 1000? (try it on a calculator)?_x0007__x0007_When you transform data, you replace the variables by a function of the original variable. In many cases, this can change the shape of the distribution. Notice how the log of a large number is a lot smaller (for 1000 you get 6.91)? A logarithmic transformation reduces positive skewness by compressing the right end of the tail and extending the left/lower end. Why does this work?_x0007__x0007_Try ln(1)-ln(.1) = on your calculator..._x0007_Try ln(10) - ln(1) = on your calculator ..._x0007_Try ln(1000) - ln(10) = on your calculator..._x0007__x0007_What do you notice? The distance between all of these are the same when you use the log scale! So why use log transformations?_x0007__x0007_Summary: the logarithm can move larger values closer together and smaller values farther apart...which can help with skewed distributions!_x0007__x0007_best,_x0007__x0007_Josh"}], "max_tokens": 3}}

However, when you take a sample mean from a sample n, that mean will ALWAYS fall within the values of your sample. You will ALWAYS get a value that is within the range of values that you have sampled. You could have a sample/calculated sample mean and have a situation where the actual population mean falls outside of your sample data. So when you are calculating the sample variance and squaring distances from your SAMPLE mean, you are more likely to get a much lower estimate than the true variance from the actual population mean. This means you are likely to be underestimating the true population variance. Using n-1 provides a better estimate!_x0007__x0007_When you divide by n-1 you divide by a smaller number than n.

As the name implies, the CI is a measure of confidence that has to do with the way you calculated the interval - it is a reflection of the test. So, if you collect many samples and calculate the CI for each sample, in the long run, 95% of these will contain the true mean. _x0007__x0007_Why is this the case? The population mean is a actually a constant - not a random variable. Since it does not change, the probability that this constant value falls within a certain range is either 0 or 1. [The range either includes the value or does not] _x0007__x0007_Like I said, The CI is a measure of uncertainty that is associated with a sampling method.

I did not notice any alpha corrections for multiple tests._x0007__x0007_I also want to know 45 and 30% more than what number exactly (this may have been a healthy group of college educated white folks)?

To find the number of events in each group, runners vs non, is it simply a multiplication problem?

This is not surprising. But then they broke runners into quintiles by different running characteristics (such as total time run, speed, and distance run). The Hazard Ratios appeared similar across the different quintiles of running activity. So, they concluded that running a little is just as good as running a lot. The headlines come from the fact that the lowest quintiles included people running <51 min per week (7 minutes per day), <6 miles , and 1 to 2 times per week. There are of course a lot of caveats! (1) When we break data into quintiles, the sample sizes in each quintile are much smaller than the sample size in the overall study. So chance may play a role. (2) People who run 51 minutes per week are probably not running 5-10 minutes per day; they are probably running 1-2 longer runs of several miles. If you are able to run several miles at once, you are probably reasonably fit and may have been running more than this at other times in your life. (3) People who run a small amount may be participating in many other physical activities; though the authors adjusted for this, it was a very crude adjustment. So residual confounding is likely. _x0007_I think we can conclude that running and exercise is good for you.

Every test you run increases the type of a chance I error, so technically you should correct for all p-values at the same time. However, bear in mind that you probably have a lot of overlap between the tests run with Cox regression and those run with logistic regression, for example. They may be so close to measuring the same thing that you are being conservative by adjusting p-values from both methods. So, I'd recommend that you narrow down the number of tests you are running by using clinical judgment. It's unlikely that you need to do both Cox regression and logistic. Pick one outcome that you care most about and focus on that. Also, given the high chance of false positives here, you might try to do some kind of validation. This would give the results more credibility."}], "max_tokens": 3}}
