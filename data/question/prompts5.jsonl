Let me pose the question differently to show that height (and many other measures) cannot be normally distributed, although it can be well approximated as normal. According to the normal distribution, there should be the same proportion of people above the mean as there are below. However, height is >0, whereas it has no maximum (although in reality there could be a limit). So, suppose the mean height is 1.6m, and 0.0001% of the population is 3.3m; if height is normally distributed, then 0.0001% of the population is -0.1m tall, which is not a valid value. The actual % is irrelevant, to the argument._x0007__x0007_In fact, if you think about the last slide on % response for feelings about math, this MAY be normal ONLY if the mean was 50% and the distribution was unimodal.

For me, the label 7 for the bar, rather than 6 .5- 7.5 (or 6.5 and 7.5 at start and end of the bar width), led initially to the interpretation, that the students were asked to record the average hours of sleep in whole hours (rounded up or down to the closest full hour) which would make it and discreet variable and consequently would make answer A the correct one, I think. _x0007__x0007_Do you agree that this could be a valid interpretation too?

The toss of a coin data set cannot be expressed as a mean. A better central tendency would be mode. Further, standard deviations only apply to comparisons from the mean, which is not a good tool in this case. Also, for binary data, how can one express an IRQ? This seems to be a better statistic for quantitative data only. If the point of set 2 was to run calculations, I think a better exercise is to use truly quantitative data. I also have commentary regarding question set 3 a. The choices were limited and since age is not continuous in this example (but rather, discrete), categorical is a better choice. On the other hand, the choice \\ordinal\\\" was not provided. Truly, age is a categorical in the ordinal subset.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Answer with only one of the options shown and label the following text: Agreed, it seems like the ethics of available race choices does not mirror reality.  But for whatever reason, these researchers only wanted to know prevalence in white vs. not white.  Perhaps it was so they could do a simple odds ratio instead of a multi-level odds ratio.  So, even though Race is not really a binary variable, it is for the purposes of this study and that's how the researchers set it up.  In other words, they only recorded white vs. not white, so it is binary.  If they recorded black vs. not black, that would be binary.  If they recorded Asian vs. not Asian, that would be binary.  If they set it up as a multi-category variable with several races, then it would no longer be binary, but categorical instead.  It just depends on how they setup the data collection categories._x0007__x0007_Another example might be if they were studying diabetes in the Americas and the choices were North America - Yes or No, then that would be binary.

I than followed the instructions but could not load the Excel file for the homework due to some error with the XLConnectJar, which I posted in a different forum post. Someone answered to my plea, but when I oppened JGR this time to try out the different file, Deducer did not load properly. The little JGR window which just blinks up when starting was empty and the window with the icons for the data import is completely blank aswell. None of the menubar links in the JGR window work and I can not enter anything in the window either. I tried to close JGR and the menu to choose to save before exit pops up, but clicking on either button does not work. I finally choose to force quit it. I tried to deinstall everything and reinstall R and Deducer but I still am having the same problems. _x0007_I am wondering if I do have the problems because I updated my Mac yesterday as it had told me that updates were available. _x0007_Does any one have any tips for me how to get JGR/Deducer to work again?_x0007_Thanks a lot in advance!"}], "max_tokens": 3}}

While rechecking I was horrified to see that my choices had actually changed and luckily I did not hit the final check button and re-corrected them and submitted them. I would have got 6 answers wrong when actually I had got all answers correct !.This problem also occurred in another Edx course and they had to change the radiobutton method to another one (The square button kind).I really look forward to the individual Save and Submit buttons for the home-works. It is really difficult to scroll up and down to save and when you are doing your homework in a \\timed\\\" manner like in an exam this can be a really painful interruption to the flow of thought.Also  in serial questions where the answer of one progresses to be a part of the question for the next question this causes a complete collapse of the next questions despite knowing the methodology(usually due to  things like rounding etc if not due to a wrong method !!). I hope these problems are solved but I really think the radio button and individual save and submit buttons should be changed at the earliest.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

I don't quite see the information content of NNT unless there is an accepted time frame in which the GI actually occurs if it ever does so. Thoughts appreciated.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Perhaps what's more important is that to treat a discrete variable as continuous in a way that makes sense, it should be ordinal and the difference between adjacent classes should be identical in value. Eg. even though the age groupings (0-10, 10-20, 20-30, ... ) and (0-10, 10-30, 30-40, ...) are discrete, the former can be more easily treated as continuous than the latter."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

I found it when I tried to build a 2x2 table with this data and I could not get the numbers to come out right.  One of my sums of marginal probabilities was not coming out to 1.0, so I knew something was wrong.  (Always check the sum of the marginals, as we have been taught!)_x0007__x0007_By the way, before taking this course, I used to call a 2X2 table a \\Sackett matrix\\\", because I learned about it in \\\"Clinical Epidemiology\\\", by Sackett et al.  I recommend this book to anyone looking for more info than is provided in the course. (I have 2nd edition, there are later ones.) _x0007__x0007_Of course I soon came to realize that this topic would be discussed at much greater length in the later units of this course, so you may not need Sackett's book after all ;-)_x0007__x0007_I was curious about who first used the 2X2 table.  It's so simple and yet so useful. I think the theory of it goes back to WWII era, when ROC theory was worked out for radar signal detection.

If we test the pool of A & B's blood, and the test is negative for the disease, you can apply Bayes' theorem and update the probabilities of A & B having the disease to 0. Similarly, if we test C & D's blood, and the test is positive, the probabilities of each of C & D having the disease becomes 0.5. You can then perform a test on C.

This course has helped me to understand more precisely what they are now, and that has helped brilliantly. However, these days we need to be very careful when reviewing data submitted in artciles and checking that conclusions made from the analysis are logical and supported by the data themselves. All too often we get articles which draw conclusions which are not supported by the analysis, or in which half of the blatently obvious implications are overlooked/ignored/manipulated in phraseology (similar to the Vioxx study). My chief seems to have forgotten his statistical knowledge, e.g. when I point out columns in chart data with very overlapping SD bars which are marked as significant, he is not always as concerned as I am. And I am not always so confident of what my instinct/knowledge tells me. So I worry. I worry something will slip through that I should have spotted. _x0007_Another example, I have pointed out linear regression plots with 'significant correlation' which clearly have two subpopulations of data (ie data points grouped into two, non-overlapping 'clouds' which the authors have not mentioned or concerned themselves with._x0007__x0007_Today I have an odds ratio of 0.9997 with a 95% CI of 0.9996-1.0001, which is marked as having a p-value of 0.0004. Is that logical? I have seen (but not yet studied) the video on p-values and (not)comparing them. I don't usually compare them. This one is not a comparison as such, just it struck me as being rather high for an OR well within the CI. I think perhaps I haven't understood the concept of having a siginificant OR that lies within the CI. I think my understanding was that if the OR is within the CI then there is 95% chance it is not significantly different from 1. Is that not the case? _x0007__x0007_I've always considered my stats grounding good, but ORs/HRs etc were not in the scope of what I did. _x0007_Should I be worried about this OR?_x0007__x0007_If not when should I consider an OR as possibly being suspect?_x0007__x0007_Sorry for the length of my post.

The \\\"mixed\\\" part is to account for the correlation in the data, since they come from repeated measures on the same patients (the study is \\\"longitudinal\\\"). _x0007__x0007_The whole \\\"mixed models\\\" stuff has been a hot topic in biostats for at least a decade now. Its conception goes way back in time of course, but with software advances its use is now beginning to spread in clinical journals. It allows a lot more flexibility than traditional methods, so be prepared to see a *lot* more of those models in the near future. This is certainly so for \\\"linear mixed models\\\" for continuous outcomes, but I guess their \\\"generalized\\\" cousins for other types of outcomes are making progress fast. Needless to say, one must know how to handle this stuff, and I'm not sure what \\\"guarantees\\\" a reviewer should ask to ensure proper use. It's a topic worth of some on-line search!_x0007__x0007_Now, regarding the small values of the coefficients, this is probably due to the tiny units of measurement (*micromoles*, right?), as Kristin has pointed above. Remember that a regression coefficient reflects changes for a *unit* difference in the corresponding predictor._x0007__x0007_The gem of the posts, of course, is the apparent CI/p-value discrepancy for regression-estimated odds ratios. This is something that has happened to me when running standard logistic regression (not the \\\"mixed\\\" variety that you mention). I was also incredulous at first, until some search showed that they are calculated using different approximations! I'd think that something similar applies in this case also. For more details, see for example this link, I think you will find it enlightening:_x0007__x0007_http://www.epietalum.net/content/p0001-ci-085-731-or-how-can-confidence-interval-risk-ratio-include-1-if-p-value-0001_x0007__x0007_So, my message is this: cheer up, all hope is not lost!\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Having survived 5 years, there are no other branches of the tree she could travel down to reach the surviving group of 20% (the 0.20 group) because all the other branches are truncated in death. The probability of surviving 10 years is therefore still 0.20 ._x0007__x0007_It seemed unusual to me that the answer should be found in the given information in the question but I concluded that this question was all about being clear headed and not confusing the wood for the trees and answered 20%.

The reason for that is because the 50 men would increase the height range to the sample and therefore the standard deviation would be bigger causing confidence interval to get wider. Then in question 5, the reason the confidence interval would be narrower when we increase the number of subject in the sampling is the higher the n the more accurate our data will be and therefore CI would be narrower. Is that the correct way of reasoning? I think Unit 5 is harder than the previous two units. I can do calculation, but when it comes to reasoning out statistic I am easily confused. :-)"}], "max_tokens": 3}}

So in real life, the fact that a study can use a proportion of anything and get a predictive value (and a risk ratio and other measures) gives credence to those people who disdain statistics as measures that obfuscate information rather than help to inform.  I know there are other measures a study must meet in order to be valid - but still.  I wish whatever organization makes rules about statistics would invalidate the use of a proportion (probability) unless certain parameters were given - it is the romantic in me talking.

This can be confusing.

There should be an underlying assumption that the result (and any result) is chance and the p value measures the probability of that chance finding if the null hypothesis were true, ie what are the chances of getting that finding if the null hypothesis is true not what is the chance the finding arose by chance.  The p value can't measure the probability of it being a chance finding but rather the chance of the finding given the null hypothesis. If the value seems too extreme then you either 1)reject the null hypothesis or 2)conjecture that you have witnessed a very low probability event. This is a very important distinction.

I'm trying to keep distinct the concepts of standard deviation and standard error - the former describes variation within a sample, whereas the latter describes variation of a statistic coming from multiple samples. My trouble comes with the formula: std err = std dev/sqrt(n), which I thought was true for a mean of any distribution. If that were the case, a binomial would have standard error = sqrt(n*p*(1-p))/sqrt(n) = sqrt(p*(1-p)). But the video around 3:15 has std err = std dev = sqrt(n*p*(1-p)), which seems to mush together these concepts that I'm trying to keep separate.

Answer with only one of the options shown and label the following text: Laura, your suggesting is like a binary search algorithm. Eg. in video example, if there's 100 people and only 1 person has the disease, then it would only take 7 tests to determine who had it. Test a pool of 50. If negative, look at the other 50; if positive then look at this 50. Test a pool of 25 remaining. If negative ... So 7 tests will get you the one person._x0007__x0007_The problem becomes if more than 1 person has the disease. One possibility is to shuffle the pools and test them. The number of pools and shuffles would have to be large enough that we could distinguish a single person from another person. Going back to your example, suppose we have 8 people (1-8). Suppose we first pool P1(1,2,3,4) and P2(5,6,7,8) and test both. Now we shuffle the pools so that we have P3(1,2,5,6) and P4(3,4,7,8) and test both. And shuffle again P5(1,5,3,7) and P6(2,4,6,8). Here are our possibilities:_x0007__x0007_If 1 positive -> P1, P3, P5 positive_x0007_If 2 positive -> P1, P3, P6 positive_x0007_If 3 positive -> P1, P4, P5 positive_x0007_If 4 positive -> P1, P4, P6 positive_x0007_If 5 positive -> P2, P3, P5 positive_x0007_If 6 positive -> P2, P3, P6 positive_x0007_If 7 positive -> P2, P4, P5 positive_x0007_If 8 positive -> P2, P4, P6 positive_x0007__x0007_So if our test show P1, P2, P4, P6 to be positive, then we know persons 4 and 8 are positive. If P1, P3, P4, P5 show positive, then we know persons 1 and 3 are positive. If P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 positive, then persons 1, 3, 5 and 7 are positive. So in this case, we required 2xlog2(N) tests instead of the log2(N) tests required for the binary search case. So, effectively, we could determine all the positives in a population of 100 by conducting 2xlog2(100) ~ 14 tests regardless of the prevalence of the disease._x0007__x0007_I think my logic is correct. But I'd like to hear what others think about this strategy."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

What I didn't realize is that the chart on Math Is Fun has different values than the charts in the lectures.  I even read the intro sentence to the chart which said, \\The table shows the area from 0 to Z.\\\"  Apparently this 0 is not the same \\\"zero\\\" as I expected.  I assumed they meant the zero that is located at the y-axis line.  Instead, this 0 is the mean.  If I was warned that this chart displayed its information differently than the chart in the lectures, then I would have gotten questions 3 and 4 correct.  I answered 43 women (as opposed to 7) because that's what the chart seemed to be telling me.  And 100-43=57 women made even less sense, since I knew the answer had to be less than 50%.  I was very confused with these two problems, but had to submit my homework anyway since time was running out._x0007__x0007_I guess what I'm asking is if questions 3 and 4 could be not counted for the grade.  And in future iterations of this course, please, just add a jpeg of the chart (from the lectures) in the homework.  Or, if you absolutely have to link to the Math Is Fun chart, please first explain how, unlike the lectures, the chart shows the area from the mean to Z, as opposed to from Z to zero as in the lectures (and how their statement \\\"from 0 to Z\\\" really means \\\"from mean to Z\\\")._x0007__x0007_Not that I'm upset. :)  Maybe a wee bit irked, is all.

STIP1 influences the creation of new neurons, for example, while cypin affects the number of branches they have. CRMP1 and CRMP2 stop neurons from growing and determine their length. YBX1 is involved in gene transcription, as well as neural migration during development. Finally, LDH is the most mysterious of the sextet but is also the most strongly linked to autism.

I'm missing a point here but I don't know where. thank you very much."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Being in the confidence interval still means you cannot reject, but now, if you are outside of the interval, it makes a difference which side you are on. That's because being more than 1.96 standard errors in one direction is not an unexpected result (the data is not too unusual), while being more than 1.96 standard errors in the other direction is unexpected or unusual. I'm using 1.96 because it's a 95% confidence interval._x0007__x0007_If the null is, $$p_0 > 0.20$$_x0007_Then being bigger than the confidence interval does not seem unusual.

In that direction, we are saying our sample value is no greater than 1.96 SE's from the true value._x0007__x0007_Now, suppose your sample gives a value that is more than 1.96 SE's below 0.20 .

However i think that clinical significance is not a 'statistical' question but a question to be answered by a clinician. Therefore there can be no statistical standards set for what is or is not clinically significant. As in the oft repeated example a reduction of blood pressure by 1 mm of Hg might not be considered of any clinical value but a reduction of 10 mm of Hg in blood pressure might be worth looking at. In the example you give anyone treating obesity could tell you that a 1 lb difference is insignificant but a 10 lb or even a 5 lb difference seems worth aiming for and so the latter figures could be 'clinically interesting' or 'clinically significant'.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

(1) the n I saw in the question for Homework 6 are the n's mentioned in the tables. Table 2 was the adjusted odds ratios for premenonpausal women (n=878) then in Table 3, the n = 2949. Then further down the question the author mentioned looking at ductal (1008 cases) vs. lobular CA (181 cases). It appeared to me that the count in the study described referred to the cancer cases and not the person. So, the cases are not totally independent since a person can also have more than one cancer at the same time. Is that the right reasoning? (2) I am also having a hard time figuring out the unit of observation, since it is an association of two different factors: caffeine consumption and breast cancer. Should I look at it as the caffeine is the exposure and the breast cancer is the effect? Thanks again for the help and the wonderful course."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Has the video been shortened? If so, does this mean one should disregard what had been said? What is going on?_x0007__x0007_I also have a quick comment/question on Bonferroni and the alternatives. The original worry regarding multiple tests could, I believe, be put as follows: Assume that one does not wish ones rate of type I error to exceed a value $?$, for any null hypothesis. Assume that one runs a set of independent tests for $n > 1$ hypotheses $H_1,ldots, H_n$, each with a rate of type I error of $?$. Assume that rejecting a hypothesis entails rejecting any logically stronger hypothesis. Then ones wish regarding rejection rates cannot be fulfilled: the rate of type I error pertaining to the conjunction $H$ of the $H_i$ will be strictly greater than $?$ (the rate of type I errors for $H$ will be equal to the probability of making a type I error for at least one of the $H_i$s, i.e. $1 - (1  ?)^n > ?)$. This, however, can be avoided if one notably sets the rate of type I error of the $H_i$'s to a value no greater than $1  sqrt[n]{1  ?}$. The Bonferoni correction demonstrably achieves this, yielding a rate for the $H_i$'s that is extremely close to, yet smaller than, $1  sqrt[n]{1  ?}$. The alternatives considered here (Holm, Hochberg), however, do not address the above concern, as far as I can see (correct?). So how exactly would these procedures be motivated? Have I misconstrued the worry that motivated Bonferroni? If I have, what *was* the worry then?_x0007__x0007_All the best,_x0007__x0007_Jake"}], "max_tokens": 3}}

The 19th century rulings stem from the same myth, likely created by Gilleray's famous cartoon of Justice Buller that I mentioned before. There has never been any such official law of 'rule of thumb' relating to domestic abuse. In fact the 17th century law of 'moderate chastisement' (salva moderate castigatione) never permitted physical abuse, for all that this particular law is still oppressive by more modern standards. Where it is mentioned in 19th century court proceedings is down to the credulity of the persons quoted. This continues today thanks to this myth being repeated time and again without correction. Many languages have phrases similar to 'rule of thumb' which mean the same thing (i.e., a general principle broadly applied). It is not an offensive phrase in English or non-English-speaking regions. In addition, the correct (true) meaning should be abundantly clear from the context. Sorry to go on, but I find the criticism made over this phrase to be pointless."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

How does it know how to pick its random D levels or test scores if it doesn't use the s/sqrt(n) formula???_x0007_Or is this explained in some later module, or perhaps is just beyond the scope of this course? And I could live with the answer that it's just beyond the scope of the course, but I at least want to know if it is.*_x0007__x0007_*.....Cause it's not like it's picking purely random numbers and possibly saying in one simulation that all 1<zipRedac><zipRedac> men had d levels above 2<zipRedac><zipRedac> nmol/L.

In my mind, quizzes would prepare one for the homework, but this is very rarely the case. The homework questions are often far advanced compared to the very easy quiz questions.

If there were multiple choice questions, I think that would be a better test of true understanding...I have often completely understood the material and the concepts presented but lost points on homework due to math mistakes. _x0007__x0007_The other frustration I have is that I'm not always sure what the homework is testing. Instead of testing knowledge of concepts, it often seems to be testing math skills...Dr. Sainini remarks often about \\but you won't need to calculate this, you'll have statistics software that does this\\\"...but then on the homework instead of being asked to interpret data we do rote calculations. I think the most egregious sample of this so far is the Homework 7. Every lecture, before she showed the methodology, she repeatedly stated \\\"But you won't have to calculate this, this is what the software will do for you\\\", yet a very substantial portion of the homework is performing calculations that according to her our software should be doing for us. Again, I don't think this tests understanding of concepts so much as math skills.

Let me try to explain why. I can only see one plausible interpretation of the claim that the significant result in question is ''most likely a chance finding''. This interpretation is the following_x0007__x0007_'The significant result is most likely a chance finding' means that we would have expected, prior to gathering the data, to obtain significant data on this particular test by chance alone, i.e. even on the assumption that $H$ is true._x0007__x0007_Now of course, as we all know, in a battery of 50 independent tests, the probability, conditional on $H$, of obtaining at least one result with a p-value lower than .05 is fairly high. Indeed, it is equal to $1 - 0.95^{50}$, which is roughly 0.92. But this, true as it may be, does *not* entail that the probability of obtaining significant data *on this particular test*, i.e. on the test for $H_1$, is high, conditional on $H$. Indeed, it is as low as it would have been in the absence of all the remaining tests, namely 0.05. _x0007__x0007_In other words: although it is correct to say that one should have expected to obtain a significant value for at least one statistic by chance alone, it is simply *incorrect* to say of any particular statistic that one should have expected it to have a significant value by chance alone.\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Answer with only one of the options shown and label the following text: Thank you guys for your help. What I am exciting about in statistics is the fact that you cannot be absolutely sure about anything  however, this is also the reason why it can be so irritating sometimes :-) The fact about hypothesis testing is that neither hypothesis is true. After a test, you end up with a p-value that must be explained. The idea is to keep significance level low and power high, and yes, in the most cases, we try to formulate our hypothesis in such way that we go after the alternative one. However most importantly is to formulate the null hypothesis based on a clear probability model  something you can calculate with  otherwise it makes no sense at all. Anyway, I am still puzzled about the way we can explain p-values. Yes, if a p-value is 0.5, this means we cannot reject null hypothesis. But do we have any other indication? Or may we use the results from the test in order to formulate our next step? Is that a kind of bias? I think I need to research the subject more deeply;-). Thank you."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

You can read through the final questions when you get a little open time and answer any that are easy. There are some very straightforward, basic, and probably easy questions (eg. find a z-score). You can save the answers to any you answer so that you can review later. Just try a few whenever you get a chance. Make a note of anything you need to research. Return later. Second, there are only a few questions from Unit 9, and again, you can wait to answer those. Third, if you have handed in all of the HW, and if you have had similar scores on each, then HW 9 may have no meaningful effect on your HW average and thus your semester result. That means it may be more sensible to concentrate on the final more than the HW._x0007__x0007_In the end, my impression is that the final was easier than the HW. For one thing, everything was multiple choice, so on numerical questions, the choices provided some hint as to if you were proceeding correctly. Also, when I first saw the \\every question is individually submitted\\\" style, it struck me as looking very tedious. In the end, I liked it. I was able to remove questions that I was very confident of from the list by submitting them. This made me feel better as I inched towards 60% and also inched towards completeing the exam. In the end, I finished the final first and turned in the HW today. Again, I found the HW was much harder than the final._x0007__x0007_I also thought of something. In school, it is often the case that the final exam must be taken very soon after the last day of instruction and also perhaps on the same day as another final. That certainly isn't ideal from a preparation standpoint. _x0007__x0007_In the end, I'm not sure that the schedule for the final and HW9 was that big of a deal for many students. I generally avoid direct advice about telling people to change their study habits, but I'm breaking my rule here. I think the final and HW9 will be easier to complete if you alter any ridgid HW schedule you've been using. Work on the final at least while you're doing HW9. Get a decent first draft of HW 9 completed and then concentrate on the final. Don't get too invested i\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Does this mean the test group had a 29% increase in rate of thyroid cancer for every 10 centimeters that they were taller than controls? This is where I am confused because if that is true, an individual would have over 100% incidence rate if she were >34 cm (13 inches) taller than a reference person, right? Or can it not be interpreted that way because a hazard rate is instantaneous and not an overall incidence rate?_x0007__x0007_http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/early/2013/07/25/1055-9965.EPI-13-0305.abstract_x0007__x0007_Thanks for your input."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

She could have developed the outcome, but didn't. That means that her data contribute something to the study. If you keep her data in, the overall likelihood of any patient developing the outcome up until the point she dropped out will be lower than if you took her data out (because her contribution make the denominator higher by 1 person). If the study had planned to end at 6 months, you would have been OK with including her data - so it should be no different if she later drops out because her inclusion affects only the data up to 6 months. You can't do clinical studies without patients dropping out, so you have to accommodate that fact rather than ignore it."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

The course is exciting marvelous, very  useful to all as me who are working at the health sector. Medical world has radically changed with the becoming of computers and the web. We have passed from Statistical Descriptive Medicine to the Evidence Based Medicine. Now we are living the era of Inference Medicine. Course is very well designed. It is of very considerable value for those who are doing medical research. Each module begins with the appearing of the lovely and beautiful PhD <redacted>, pretty dressed, with the prevailing fashion style in nowadays time and the neccessary voice for learning statistics.

I can't say I am confident with all the material you covered in this course, Dr. <redacted>, but I hope to keep working on it and get everything clear in my mind. What was special about this course was your attention to interpretation rather than just calculation (like many other Stats courses do); generally it was the questions related to interpreting certain values and deriving conclusions that were harder for me than the ones involving calculation of something like Z values or confidence intervals. I hope that going over all you essays in the Optional Readings section will make be better able to derive the correct conclusions from data.

I think what is being said is... as it is only the people whose gender and treatment are each rated as 1 (rather than 0) that can have a possible interaction between gender and treatment, that means all comparisons are between those (males on drug) versus the other option (either females or placebo, depending if we are comparing gender or treatment). So the females or placebos are our reference groups depending on which variable we are comparing. So, females are our reference group in the example detailed. This means we can now we say that, in females, the treatment effect is beta treatment. To calculate the treatment effect in males, we have to allow for any interaction of gender with treatment. So, in males, the treatment effect is beta treatment plus this adjustment."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

This \\\"Z range\\\" of 1.34 corresponds to the range from the bottom value to the top value of the IQR. _x0007__x0007_Multiply 1.34 by 1.5 gives you 2.01.  Add that to the Z of +0.67 (which corresponds to the top value of the IQR) and you have Z= 2.68 . _x0007__x0007_Plus Minus Z of 2.68 corresponds to 99% of the area under the Std Normal Curve.  Hence anything past the whisker is a real outlier. _x0007__x0007_All much easier to see if you draw out the bell curve.

I could read abstracts and grasp what these experts were telling me, so I could argue my points in court.  I actually spoke with William Castelli of Framingham Heart fame to try to get him to be an expert witness in one of our lawsuits.

I have been looking for a way to gain a better understanding of many aspects of statistics in medicine for many years. This course has been so much more helpful than trying to battle through a textbook. In particular, it has been a joy to finally be clear on which tests are used in which situations - something that can be so difficult to pick up from other sources. I particularly appreciated the information about the non-parametric tests as these are sometimes ignored and sidelined in other places whereas I come across them frequently in my work._x0007__x0007_To me, the course has been a rush as I had only about 3 weeks to get through it. But, it had been beyond my dreams that I would find something as good as this and so easily available - so I was determined to take advantage of it. It sounds like others may also have had some time pressures with it too. If so, perhaps a longer timeframe might be considered in future? Or at least a 'breather/catchup week' once or twice. Also, it may have been because of the rush and time pressure I was under, but I didn't understand for a while the iconography on the top bar that directs you from module to quiz to sometimes more modules and quizzes. I had no idea what the symbols were supposed to represent and just thought it was something that wasn't displaying properly on my screen and so ignored it - not discovering some of the material and some of the quizzes for quite a while. It would be helpful to have some text next to or on the icons so this is more obvious. I realize this may be just the template you have to work within and, if so, perhaps an instruction to bring our attention to this at the end of the first module might help. (Apologies if there was one and I missed it in my rush. But I read of at least one other person who missed the quizzes completely, presumably for the same reason.)_x0007__x0007_Thank you once again. It appears that you and your coworkers have improved the statistical knowledge of many many people all over the world in the last few weeks and, as many of your examples illustrated, this is much needed. That is quite some achievement - congratulations!"}], "max_tokens": 3}}

I have had two stats courses in my MS and yet this course helped me clear so many concepts. The content has been presented so nicely. I liked the idea of teasers and explaining statistics with the help of real examples from literature. That's what got me into the course and I loved it. Again, the idea of distinction above 90% is very thoughtful as it compelled me to learn and do my best till the very end.. And in the end it did become tense, when I had overall score of 88% and two more questions to go on the final exam. It was do or die situation and it was a big relief when I ended up with 92%._x0007__x0007_Can I request you to send an email notification in case you and your team are putting up another statistics course in future?_x0007__x0007_Thanks again!"}], "max_tokens": 3}}

You were very engaging and it was obvious that you are your team put your heart and soul into this. I took an undergraduate and graduate statistics course, but because this was presented in the framework of medical statistics, I learned a lot of new concepts. It has made a big difference for me, and I am so proud to put on my resume that I completed a statistics course from Stanford University._x0007__x0007_It is heartbreaking for me, because I missed the 90% distinction by ONE QUESTION on the final! I am a bit OCD, so it is so hard for me to get over this. I keep thinking about the questions that I could have answered differently -- I know what the answers are. Also, I did not rely on others' help on the discussion forum to take my homework, which would have inflated my homework score. I found the discussion forum hard to navigate, and with as many hours as I was putting into the course, I did not have any time left to research the answers on the forum. Also, I wanted this course to be a true test of my own knowledge, not what I could learn from others' input, so I feel like my score was accurate to my own abilities. If I had spent time on the forum, I am sure I would have my distinction right now very handily._x0007__x0007_Through reading others' posts about being so close, I was wondering if there would be any accommodations or a final \\curve\\\" of 1% for those who were SO CLOSE such as myself! If not, I will have to live with this, but I just put in so many countless hours and would have been so happy to have made the distinction cutoff._x0007__x0007_Regardless, thank you so much for your passion for statistics and your commitment to this course. I am already signed up for Writing in the Sciences and look forward so much to taking another course with you!! :-)_x0007__x0007_If you have any thoughts on making any accommodations for those of us who were PAINFULLY close, it would make a difference._x0007__x0007_Thanks again,_x0007_<nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>\""}], "max_tokens": 3}}

It's certainly true that an introductory statistics class can be taught without a large amount of math; e.g., no calculus.  But at some point, if you want to really understand the concepts, you have to sit down and do some math.  And most people don't fully grasp the mathematics until they actually do some 'mechanical' calculations.  I also don't agree that learning to use the software is completely different from understanding statistics.  If you don't have some understanding of the concepts, you won't use the software correctly, and your results will be highly accurate but meaningless.  I'm glad that Dr. <redacted> gave us guidance on how to choose the right statistical method, but given that we never actually DID some of these methods, how are you going to successfully perform them with ANY piece of software and have any confidence in the results?"}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Answer with only one of the options shown and label the following text: Thanks for the post! I think the last example of material at the link brings a very good point. As applied to human drug studies, the parallel is that all the humans are very different, and there could be no (or vanishingly small) direct correlation between the fact that you take drug and medical effect. But as you start averaging, and use very large groups of people, you can start seeing trends (even tiny). I guess the conclusion is that the drug is not doing any good for you personally, but is of some merit for public health (financially optimizing national health care budget). Please notice that the bird example has a large number of observation data points analyzed (<zipRedac>0000), so statistical power of such study is big, that's why the trend is visible. _x0007__x0007__x0007_To see the effect projected to an individual, smaller studies could be used, say 30 birds observed. In that case the observations could be more related to each individual (or could be simply findings by chance :-)). Less random noise (more correlation) -> you don't need a lot of data in a sample to see the effect! I am not saying <zipRedac>0000 points is worse than 30, it just starts bringing up small details often irrelevant in practice. If you have a systematic component and noise on top of it, you need dampen the noise by multiple averaging, while keeping the systematic portion (in a simplistic homogenous group not affected by averaging). Then if you want to see systematic effect Es, you need to design study with enough of data points to bring Erandom averages below Es to see the effect._x0007__x0007_At any rate, seeing x-y scatter plot for all the data available is extremely instrumental."}], "max_tokens": 3}}

The author's use the word *re-infusion*, which only appears in the 2nd clause, avoids the need to introduce the lymphocytes' origins--their origin is implicit. *\\Re-infusion\\\"* informs the reader that lymphocytes were extracted from a host--they had to come from somewhere!--only to be re-infused back into the same (autologous) tumor-bearing host. This phrasing, or *selective vagueness*, allowed the lymphocytes to almost appear out of thin air!_x0007__x0007_ 2. When I rewrote the sentence, replacing the -ion nouns with verbs, the sentence's context forced me to choose the lesser of two evils: either use my new-found spunky verbs in the passive voice or explain who (or what) selects, activates, and expands the lymphocytes. For each verb there are many possible subjects; including this information would eliminate the succinctness of the summary of the lymphocytes involvement in adoptive cell transfer (ACT)._x0007__x0007_Despite the predicament of (2), I like the new sentence with verbs.

I am asking because we have just modified during Unit 1 a lot of sentences that I usually see in medical and scientific world-leading journals and it looked a lit bit strange for me, why journals' editors don't make any comments regarding the style of the articles if they are written not in line with scientific writing principles?_x0007__x0007_Many thanks,_x0007_<nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>"}], "max_tokens": 3}}

Focused ion-beam scanning electron microscopes (Knott et al. 2008) deliver quality images but their sample size limit is vulnerable to damage.

An extracellular stain was applied to a 200-micron retina piece containing a starburst amacrine cell with the arborization field. _x0007__x0007_Their map clarified the cellular circuit and identified putative synapses. The intracellular synaptic features were unobservable with the initial stain and a second sample was stained to show these. The results with the initial and second sample stains were correlated. _x0007_ _x0007__x0007_The findings reveal the directionally-selective wiring of starburst amacrine cells.

It seems from the original sentence, the paper does not provide a complete overview of Quantum Physics, but only an overview of the basic principle.

Generally if you have that at the beginning of a sentence, I would assume the earlier sentence explains the theory.

The Madagascar Hissing cockroach was used because of: its larger size (~50-75mm), slow speed (~3cm/s), long life span (~2 years) and robustness. Latif and Bozkurt developed a wireless biological interface, that uses an electronic stimulus, to remotely steer cockroaches by way of their antennae (called cerci) to sense: tactility, temperature and humidity. Researchers used these antennae to drive the cockroaches by sending a series of electrical pulses to them. This concept helps to create a mobile web of sensors that use cockroaches to collect and transmit data, to enable locating survivors in inaccessible areas during earthquakes._x0007_ _x0007_The system consists of: a microprocessor with Zigbee interface* electrodes and a battery. The user controls the microprocessor wirelessly using a Zigbee transceiver; the microprocessor sends electrical pulses to the cockroachs antennas using electrodes and then the cockroach moves. The researchers evaluated two microprocessors that control the electrodes: Microchip's PIC16F630#  and Texas Instruments CC2530^. The CC2530 was better because: of its low weight (500mg), Zigbee module connectivity and the availability of 21 general purpose I/O. The CC2530 gets its power from the 90mAh Li-Po battery._x0007_  _x0007_Before the experiment started, the cockroaches were anesthetized by cold-treatment (4C) for 45-60 minutes. They attached one side of the electrodes (5cm long stainless steel coated with 250um thick Teflon) to the antennae to serve as electronic reins, which injected small charges into the roachs neural tissue. The charges trick the roach into thinking that the antennae are in contact with a physical barrier, which effectively steers them in the opposite direction._x0007__x0007_The cockroaches followed an S-shaped trajectory drawn on the laboratory floor and spent 81 sec. with 10% success rate to complete the route.

My older students would be expected both to understand and use more complex and nuanced language forms._x0007__x0007_When writing for a specialised audience of fellow professionals, are we really to conclude that our readers' interest is so transitory that the lack of 'spunky' active verbs will deter them from reading a paper?

This recruitment stabilizes the nucleosomes and signals transcriptional repression in the end. The thing is that it seems by the original sentence to be a sequential process which ends up in the recruitment of sin3/HDAC, which is the crucial step to associate H3K4me3 with transcriptional repression instead of gene activation.

The two most common types of primary disorders are episodic tension-type headache (ETTH) and migraine. Secondary disorders are a consequence of an underlying condition, such as a brain tumour, a systemic infection or a head injury._x0007__x0007_ _x0007_Although IHS is the most broadly recognised classification system, there are others that have epidemiological advantages.

When I think about it now, it seems we put whatever is more important in the beginning of the sentence, be it the object or the subject of the verb. When subject comes ahead of the verb, it natural anyway. However, the unique thing is, when the object comes first, the sentence is turned into an active voice by using another verb to drive the noun form of the original verb. It feels very natural too. For example, \\samples are treated with ethylene prior to... \\\" is turned into \\\"samples uses ethylene treatment...\\\". When I read the second construction in Chinese, I'll just pickup \\\"samples\\\", \\\"ethylene treatment\\\" instinctively. Forcing the sentence to go passive would be really bizarre to me._x0007_Anyhow, what I am trying to say is, maybe the preference on active voice is just a property of language itself, rather than just English. Why would we engage in an effort to betray the instinct and make ourselves sound formal/objective/authoritative... when there is no good reason to do so.

APA has been nice and clear about how to cite DOI in its most recent style guide.

There is no mention of DOI. Of course, I could defer to the Reference section of their past articles but I do see inconsistencies.  _x0007__x0007_I am wondering how editors address this issue.
