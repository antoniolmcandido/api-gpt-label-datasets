However, if the teacher knows how to differentiate properly, they can challenge your child, within the same confines of the concept being learned, at a deeper level.

They will make up their own word problems, solve the problems and give reasoning to solutions (how they got it and why it works). Showing more than one method for each solution is a Bonus. Students will work in teams; they will collaborate to produce a piece of work that satisfies the rubric of the project. They will use Technology and present their product to the class Using PowerPoint.  They will be practical by writing problems that connects to everyday life, and creative in their presentations demonstrating skills of the 21st Century skills.",

It helps get away from the idea that math is about one right answer (in this case 10), and moves toward the idea that math is about multiple approaches.  It can help people feel like their contributions are interesting and important.  It could also be a good setting to develop good group discussion norms.  You also get to see how numbers are made up of other numbers, which leads into interesting things later.  (E.g. you can't do 15*12 = 15*10 + 15*2 without knowing that 12 can be broken into 10 and 2.  In this video an interesting thing we saw is that 10 = 4+3+2+1, which is part of a very interesting series (triangle numbers)).",
