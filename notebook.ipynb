Answer only one number and label the following text: I think this falls on the teacher.  Someone spoke to this above... because if you have a teacher that is just terrible and doesn\\'t know how to manage a class of mixed ability, you get very bored \\\\gifted\\\\\" students.  However, if the teacher knows how to differentiate properly, they can challenge your child, within the same confines of the concept being learned, at a deeper level.  Not just making your child do MORE work... but have your child do DIFFERENT work around the same topic.  Sometimes that can be as easy as asking one question to take it deeper.  _x0007__x0007_The problem I\\'ve seen with this, however, is that sometimes those \\\\\"gifted\\\\\" students still know in their head that they are getting different work.  They still think that they\\'re smarter than the other kids, so they will tend to call the class boring.  Even though the teacher is definitely challenging the kid.  I\\'ve heard kids say, \\\\\"this class is easy\\\\\" when I KNOW I have challenged them with difficult questions on a daily basis that they struggle with.  I had a girl tell me my Honors Geometry class (as an 8th grader) was easy.  I laughed... I said, \\\\\"This class isn\\'t EASY!  You just got an A on a High School Geometry Honors Mid-Term.  That\\'s hard to do!  It\\'s not easy... I watch you work HARD every day!  I see you thinking... I see you struggle... I watch you debate... This is work!   And you work hard!  Just because you got an A, doesn\\'t mean it\\'s easy.\"'}],\n",

Instead, I will be here to encourage you, ask you lots and lots of questions and learn along with you. None of us knows it all, and none of us will be the end of the year together.  I expect to learn about your thinking and hopefully some math as well. You should expect to learn about math but also about your own thinking.

I have 25 years of mathematics teaching experience at the junior high/middle school levels.  My present position consisted of students completing mathematics lessons on the computer using the PLATO learning platform.  Then the county switched to APANGEA.  Last year the APANGEA learning platform changed its name to Think Through Math.  When students return to school in August, they will be using MATHIA from Carnegie.  _x0007__x0007_I really look forward to this class, as I hope to gain some new ideas and learn from the recent research on strategies and techniques on how to get students to learn math.  This is extremely important because I teach in a low socio-economical school and whose student population is not real excited about mathematical learning.'}],\n",

Answer only one number and label the following text: I think it helps people see that even the simplest things, like counting have multiple approaches, that are like and unalike in interesting ways.  It helps get away from the idea that math is about one right answer (in this case 10), and moves toward the idea that math is about multiple approaches.  It can help people feel like their contributions are interesting and important.  It could also be a good setting to develop good group discussion norms.  You also get to see how numbers are made up of other numbers, which leads into interesting things later.  (E.g. you can't do 15*12 = 15*10 + 15*2 without knowing that 12 can be broken into 10 and 2.  In this video an interesting thing we saw is that 10 = 4+3+2+1, which is part of a very interesting series (triangle numbers)).\"}],\n",

Answer only one number and label the following text: My school district is like a yo-yo. We used to track starting in 3rd grade and then someone (thank goodness) must have actually read the research similar to what is presented here and we folded the tracking and went to heterogeneous grouping (keeping all our own homeroom kids) for a few years. Now, it is back to tracking since it has been deemed important that 8th graders are able to take geometry if they want! The 8th grade need pushes back to everyone so we now need to start tracking again so we can, somewhere before middle school, get a group of the \\\\smartest\\\\\" kids to skip an entire grade so they are ready for geometry. The teachers from K-8 have made case after case as to why this is not good for children but it has fallen on deaf ears. My personal goal is to get all my \\\\\"grade level\\\\\" (which is seen as the low group) students to understand they are every bit as capable as the others but it is really hard when they are given the fixed mind set messages over and over from everyone else. I am THRILLED that I have some good data to show them. I at least have science and research on my side now too!\"'}],\n",

Answer only one number and label the following text: It is scary because of the effect it has on students. I teach pre-GED level in a community college setting in the CUNY system. Many of my students in my classes are products of a failed public school system. Thus many of my students walk into my classroom the first day with a huge dark shadow of failure dogging their every effort. I am new to teaching, about two years now. It is a second career for me; I was, in another life, an education program coordinator. So I have much to learn about teaching._x0007_And although my heart is in the right place it has been a struggle for me to try to help my students overcome this heavy belief that they are failures, especially when it comes to math. _x0007_Recently I was talking to a new colleague who just joined our staff this year, but who has been teaching for awhile. She was talking about the difficulty of teaching to so many different levels of ability in our classrooms. And she is right. We do have students with such a variety of strengths and ability who come from so many different backgrounds. So it is a dilemma how to catch the attention and interest of all. But I was horrified to hear her say that she grouped her students, that she felt it was the best way to teach to all skill levels. While I know that I lose many students (we all do in these programs) for whatever reasons and few finish out the semester, I do know that by the end of the semester I can look around my classroom and see all students working together. Yes my lesson planning and teaching are always a work in progress and I have so much room for improvement, but I almost cry to think of the adults in her classes who are assigned to their group and subtly told, this is it for you, I am confirming your negative sense of your abilities. This and no higher. But until this course and the information on the brain research and mind-set for growth, formative teaching, I had no words to counter her oh so reasonable pronouncements. Now I have the language and the tools.'}],\n",

It also seems that many people can remember the exact moment when they began to  dislike math and therefore just gave up. If we can show our children that we believe they can learn maybe they won't give up so quickly. As adults we have to be willing to respectfully answer questions that students pose.\"}],\n",

Answer only one number and label the following text: I am primarily a science teacher and have effectively used inquiry based projects to teach many concepts in my classes.  It seems that one way to make math classes more 'real world' and inquiry based would be to merge class time with other subjects.  Science is the obvious example, but with the amount of data and resources available online, other subjects could work, too.  For example, a history lesson could prompt students to figure out what the current world population (or part of it, ex. Jews in Poland, native Americans in the states that were original 13 colonies) would be today if a major historical event had not happened (war, disease, colonization).  A language arts class could analyze linguistic data, and make graphs to analyze trends in word use over time._x0007__x0007_So, the question is, how do you suggest math teachers reach across departmental boundaries and work with teachers in other subjects to make math relevant to the rest of academic work and life?\"}],\n",

Finally, I thought it was interesting that the students, for the most part, recognized that talking about math with others helps them to understand math more clearly because it allows them the opportunity to compare their solution methods with other students\\' solution methods and it brings out mistakes, which are so important to learning math. It is also noteworthy that one of the students noted that \\\\\"talking about math does and doesn\\'t help\\\\\" to understand math. I wonder how it \\\\\"doesn\\'t help\\\\\" for him?\"'}],\n",

Answer only one number and label the following text: I believe a single message can have a very positive impact on students, particularly if the feedback it accompanies is specific, helps students to see what they are getting right, and provides next steps towards understanding. A bit of anecdotal evidence of the impact of such a statement: my high school literature teacher wrote a similar statement in my journal of notes for her class along with her usual observations and constructive feedback. I still remember her, her gentle guidance, the books I read in her class, and I still have the notebook some 40 years later. I still love reading. She helped me to believe in myself as a critical reader of fiction and nonfiction texts. On the other hand, a single message can also have a very negative impact. My high school math teacher helped cement my lack of self-confidence in math by very obviously patting me on the head and moving on during a difficult lesson which I was struggling to understand. Whether he intended it or not, the message I felt was, \\\\Don\\'t worry your pretty little head about it.\\\\\" I felt ashamed and stupid, and this further undermined any desire on my part to ever be noticed in math class. His was the last math class I took in high school. It took years for me to overcome the feeling that I needed to hide my lack of understanding of anything mathematical for fear of being subject to ridicule.\"'}],\n",

(talk about not being very clear) but what the formula came to be was case 1 4    case 2  4 +(4+1)= 9   case 3 9+(4+3)= 16 so case 4 would have to be 16+(4+5)=25  so I saw that each case was a square number I wasnt sure about how to get to the 100th one but knew that there must be a quick way of doing so.

Answer only one number and label the following text: I wanted to add comments to a couple of the items I did not choose in the survey about the student course.  I feel that it is better to not include for the students the information concerning what mindset data has shown for women and minorities.  My reasoning for this is that hopefully many of these students have not received the incorrect messages that some groups of people are not able to do math, and I do not want that idea put into heads that have not had those thoughts.  I am speaking from my own experiences here.  No one ever told me that I shouldn't be good at math because I am female.  The first time I ever encountered gender issues in a math class was in a graduate level math class (a male student tried to dominate the class), during the same semester in which I was taking a class in which I was looking at gender issues._x0007_I wonder about news coverage sometimes.  In discussing race related issues, t.v. anchors often review the history of race relations.  I'm not sure that that type of coverage is particularly helpful.  The other item I feel needs to be handled with caution are classroom practices, such as speed and timed tests.  While I think that is good information, I am concerned about undermining a teacher's authority.  So, if you do provide information about speed being harmful in the student course, talk to the students about ways to talk to their teachers about these topics without being confrontational.\"}],\n",

My new growth-mindset task has to do with self-evaluation.  I will use Google Docs to make a form related to each learning goal.  When a student finishes the tasks for a given goal, they will have to fill out the Google form, which will ask them to evaluate their own understanding of the goal (scale of 1 to 5), give a reason for their choice, and write what they plan to do next.  There will also be an optional \\\\Something that would help me more is...\\\\\" which they can fill in if they choose.  </p>_x0007_<p> This is a growth-mindset task because it will focus students on what the goals are and on their own perception of where they are relative to those goals.

The children sit in family groups (mixed ability) so an 11 year old might be sitting next to a 7 year old and they often help and support one another. Sometimes I set the children different challenges and differentiate the work specifically but then I let them choose their own challenge. Most children choose appropriately. I have really liked this way of working and feel it is really beneficial to all attainment groups of children.

Sometimes you will be obviously the one that knows and must help the others.  Sometimes you will not know and need help.  That is what normal society looks like.  Social gaming gives me this perspective.  It is normal to start out the noob.  As you get better at something, you may meet more people who need your help.  But schools take away this natural progression by tracking, so you are always with the same group, and the same few kids are always the leaders.\"}],\n",

I have many students who simply choose not to do the work (this is college they pay for so I do not get that).  These students do not learn but they have chosen not to learn.  Those students that put in the effort and time diligently doing all the assigned work, working with tutors and accessing other available resources needs a different approach, help to create an open mind, develop and understanding and relinquishement of anxiety.

Maybe periodically in class you can call students who are needing extra help or anyone who wants extra help to meet at a table while the class might be working on an assignment to give remedial help.  I don't know.  Then hopefully those self-help (remedial) type groups don't fit the ability grouping that can often have a negative stigma attached to them.

For instance, I have seen teacher get great results using team roles, as artificial as they are. One idea is to give each student within a team a name tag that on one side, says their role. Task Manager, Recorder/reporter, Resource Manager, Facilitator. Then on the other side, you list sample questions the student in that role might ask. And you enforce it! You have a participation quiz where you tell the students \\\\Today I\\'m going to be assessing how well you work as a team, and in particular, I will be looking at how well you perform in your role.\\\\\" This sets the expectation that you want students to ALL be involved, not just some of them.

Boy was I wrong.  It is my biggest frustration.  How do you overcome this?  How do you get students who have been told their whole lives that they are gifted in math to dig in, persevere, accept a challenge, and be willing to go back and work on concepts that they previously \\\\\"learned\\\\\"?  They are so procedural that they can\\'t apply to a different scenario.  And my colleagues don\\'t want to collaborate to come up with better solutions.  Their solution is to give them more worksheets and work out more example problems.  But this just makes it worse because the students memorize the examples and then wonder why they fail quizzes.  Anyway.  Sorry for venting a bit here.  I am really hoping for some good suggestions to change their mindset.  Thanks.\"'}],\n",

I also agree with the author that the \\\\\"fun\\\\\" and \\\\\"playing\\\\\" has been taken out of learning math.  We teach children what they SHOULD see not what they COULD see.  The notion of repetition and memory has replaced the learning of math.

The example of building a pen for a farm animal is a classic word problem, which usually gives the students the dimensions and shape of the pen to be built and the student just plug in the numbers into the correct formula.  However, by removing the \\\\given\\\\\" information and opening up the question, it makes the problem more of a growth mindset problem.\"'}],\n",

Answer only one number and label the following text: In my experience, students often arrive to my high school math classes having already decided that they are \\\\not good\\\\\" with math. I think in part because of this mind set as well as society\\'s trend toward immediate answers/gratification, they are reluctant to persevere and struggle with problems. They really want a recipe/methodology for just completing the problems quickly and without true understanding. I have also found that many of the students don\\'t realize that they math they take is cumulative. They memorize what they need to pass the current course, but because it they didn\\'t connect with it/truly understand it in the first place, it is difficult/impossible to keep it in memory and use in later math classes in the algebra sequence. _x0007__x0007_So I think, some of the problem is foundational, prerequisite knowledge being weak and not taught properly (and with the time needed for everyone to truly understand it). I agree with the comment posted about elementary teachers are often afraid of math and feel that they are \\\\\"not good\\\\\" with math - so this cycle just inadvertently continues onto with their students. So enter choice, A - I think the teaching methods and perhaps who is even teaching math at lower levels could be part of the problem too.\"'}],\n",

One question I would like to know what's everybody's idea is that do you believe that in high school we should place students in the right level math class? In Canada, high school we have three level of math class, Academic/University level, Applied/college level and basic/workplace. To register for each math class depends student & their parents, there is no qualification requested. Therefore a lot time in my grade 9/10 academic/university level course students only have grade 5/6 level of basic math skill. I find that it is very difficult for me to engage them, they feel bad and lost most of the time. I often to suggest them to take one level lower to start then later to come back to high level mat class. I am not sure if I am doing the right thing or there will have some other ways I can teach them better....Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.\"}],\n",

Answer only one number and label the following text: I have taught leveled 3rd grade, non leveled 6th grade and 7th Pre-Algebra (not leveled)and 8th grade Algebra 1A (leveled)and Algebra (leveled).  I struggle with the idea that leveling is bad.  Within each class I have huge ranges of abilities.  My classes are hardly homogeneous groupings.  For example this past year in Pre-Algebra (not leveled classes) I had students who didn't know their basic math facts and couldn't solve the most basic equations without assistance and students who could complete each task assigned with proficiency.  In Pre-Algebra I was working under the (soon to be dismissed) California State Standards.  My Math 6 classes were not leveled.  I was working under the Common Core State Standards for these classes.  I was able (for the most part) to provide challenging activities so that the high, at grade level, and low students were all able to solve and make progress towards mastering the standards.  I often saw the high students become the students of the low students.  The low students often had a better understanding of the process (and got hung up on the arithmetic) than the high students who had memorized the algorithm (process) for solving that type of problem. _x0007__x0007_That is what I love about education. Every class and every year is different.  It is our job as educators to present the material so it is challenging to the majority of the students.  I saw something in one of the blogs we have looked at - it said that you have to be ok with not being everything to every student. As long as you offer many challenging tasks you will reach all the students.\"}],\n",

You are not going to have kindergarten students in the same math class with high school students.  We are going to draw lines and group students according to some criterion.  Why does it make more sense to do it by age than by ability?  When I take yoga, I go to a beginner class, because if I go to the advanced class I will get hurt.  And the advanced students would be bored if they had to take class with me.  It would be an additional burden and water down the class if we required all yoga teachers to teach to all levels in the same class.  It just doesn't make sense.  Clearly ability grouping in math does impact students in all sorts of negative ways.  But is this more a product of the culture this video describes than the actual logic of having different levels?  What would we say about someone who said I am not going to take piano because my friend is in the fourth book and my teacher wants me to start in the first book?  We need to provide quality material at all levels and teach students to divorce their self-image from whatever level they are currently (applies to a lot of adults too), not trade age grouping for ability grouping.\"}],\n",

Believing that you are stupid or smart in one area (such as math) and being worried about making mistakes is called Fixed Mindset.  Research shows that we can help our brain grow smarter.  When we realize that where were at now is just a starting point, we can start to stretch ourselves to try harder things and stick to it when they are hard.  As we make mistakes and learn how to figure out those mistakes, we build our brain-- it is called \\\\growth mindset.\\\\\"  Research has shown that this growth mindset can not only help us get better at math or our difficult subjects but will help us to be successful for the rest of our lives.  I also think seeing a video of the brain in action might be helpful to accompany this.\"'}],\n",

I learned about how geometry can be found in nature and how these findings have encouraged the creation of objects and buildings.

It also allows the teacher to highlight a variety of students by asking students to try \\\\Jane or Kevin\\'s method this time.\\\\\" But I think the most important aspect is that is opens up students minds to more possibilities._x0007_The dot talk reminds me of a book series I have used by Greg Tang-Grapes of Math and others.\"'}],\n",

When I was seven, and my sister five, we had a computer game : Math Rabbit. We wanted to win all the prizes in the virtual carnival, so we would wake up on Saturday mornings, get on the MS Dos computer, and play for hours. Hardcore gaming wasn\\'t a term back then, but that\\'s what we would do with that silly carnival math game. It wasn\\'t mom telling us to turn up the difficulty to Level 3 or Level 4, it was just us playing at a level we felt was easy enough to be fun, at the games we felt were fun._x0007__x0007_And that fun is way more useful than being able to borrow correctly at age 8. There\\'s always age 9 for borrowing correctly, but he won\\'t learn it then either if he\\'s still afraid of math. _x0007__x0007_Rereading this, it reminds me of an analogy to books - yes, your 8 year old CAN read challenging 3rd grade texts, but isn\\'t it preferable if he\\'s reading the easy Magic Treehouse series for hours and hours rather than crying at reading a page of a thick chapter book? Reading the easy books for hours will cause him to spurt in reading level so that before you know it, he\\'s bringing home the Hobbit and Harry Potter book 7 to read because they look just as interesting as those \\\\kiddy\\\\\" books he practiced reading on.]_x0007__x0007_Seriously, find an online game that\\'s below his grade level and let him play it to give him repeated opportunities of doing math problems correctly and feeling that the problems (and thus math in general) is \\\\\"easy.\\\\\" I have seventh graders on IXL who sometimes sneak and do all the 1st grade problems just because it is a confidence boost to score a 100%, even if it\\'s for the skill Adding 1 - 10. Khan Academy is free and has these leveled-type problems too (though that site can be a pain to navigate)._x0007__x0007_Alternatively, sit down with a deck of cards (1 - 10 only, Aces being 1) and play Addition War with him, so that he sees that math with mom can sometimes take the form of a game. Every boy loves a game called \\\\\"War.\\\\\" Make sure there\\'s a \\\\\"I De-Clare War\\\\\" bout so that he has the fun of winning 10 cards at once.  After a round or two, he\\'ll decide its too easy, at which point you can graduate to Multiplication War. Again, you can use regular playing cards, or I have flashcards I got from Amazon that have fish on them. I keep the playing limited to one round a day (and I generally tutor once a week) to keep the novelty of the game, and boys BEG to play multiplication war. It also he\"'}],\n",

I would then perhaps share a story of my own mistake-making in order to let the students know that everyone makes mistakes and then have a few students volunteer to share out something that they feel they learned as a result of an initial mistake (if it was math related, it would be even better!). This would likely lead into a discussion of why it works that way, which could be supported by data and videos on the brain. Even better would be if the traits were captured on pieces of paper and then posted in the classroom (alongside an image of a growing brain) to help remind students of the things that lead to learning, so they could identify and go back to those things when in a situation where they feel they aren't learning, or are stuck, make a mistake, etc.\"}],\n",

It is wonderful seeing a 9 year old help a 12 with, say, math, and later, that 12 year old help a 9 year old with reading.

We all support each other and we believe that we will all, at our own pace, succeed, if we work hard.  It is the ethic of our room.  Just today I had an  ex-student visit the room.  She told them about how she was once the lowest reader in the class, and she wanted to give up.

I remember when it first started and it did take the students awhile to adjust to the idea.  They were distracted easily and off task, but they did adapt to the new environment.  I spent a great deal of time walking around the room and refocusing students and keeping them on task.  It got easier every year.  I cannot imagine ever going back to desks in rows!  I came up with a better way to form my groups this year. _x0007__x0007_Method:_x0007__x0007_With the help of peers, I compiled of list of thinking strengths that we believe are useful for learning math.  (Also in life)  Students were asked to put a plus in front of the two they thought were their strongest ones and a minus in front of their weakest one._x0007__x0007_Rationale:  _x0007__x0007_1.\\tI wanted my students to think about their talents and areas in which they can grow this year.  This is a step in developing metacognition. _x0007_ _x0007_2.\\tStudents think math is about getting the right answer and I wanted them to know other abilities are also important. _x0007__x0007_Follow Up:_x0007__x0007_1.\\tAfter they finished, I asked which thinking strength might bring the most success.  I used this opportunity to share the following ideas with my classes.   I believe the ability to think about mistakes and learn from them is the most useful skill on the list.  I talked about the value of errors and how mistakes cause your brain to grow.  When you make a mistake, research says your brain develops new synapses.  I hope to challenge them so that they can learn from each others errors.  I explained that my goals for the year are to develop their thinking and communication skills._x0007__x0007_2.\\tI used their responses to form my groups by considering grade, sex and thinking strengths.  I constructed groups so each one reflected a variety of thinking strengths.   _x0007_     _x0007_I also teach a traditional curriculum.  I cannot do inquiry based, but I discovered that you can make a small change that makes a big difference.  All you have to do is change WHEN you ask a question.  Ask a question you would normally ask, before the lesson and try to find one that has multiple entry points or several ways to solve it.  Let the students struggle and discuss and you answer questions.  The lesson comes from students presenting their work.  Afterwards as a class you organize their methods and fill in any gaps.  I usually try to find a couple more problems that are different but involve the same concepts.  These are not drill or skill problem'}],\n",

From finishing six years of post-secondary schooling, I have been enrolled in many math courses._x0007__x0007_Memories that relate to this topic come from my first three years of post secondary (at an Applied Arts and Technology school) before transferring to University. We had 4 math-type subjects (Math, Accounting, Financial Analysis, and Statistics). The first class 'Math' was just general maths that you would've learned in grade school and high school - this class was taken in my first semester of my first year. By the end of my third year in that college, I had classmates who were unable to graduate due to being unsuccessful in this subject, and they had taken the course minimum three times. The other three classes had similar stories about classmates being unable to graduate since they were unsuccessful in them._x0007__x0007_This is upsetting because with a little drive and encouragement - people can accomplish things. If you lose that drive and motivation at an early age, it may be harder to find and therefore - be unsuccessful in post secondary education where you are paying for the provided schooling. We as teachers, need to plant an urge to learn and work math subjects with the children so they have the proper skills, knowledge and work ethic for future challenges, not just in maths, but other everyday tasks.\"}],\n",

Answer only one number and label the following text: I think much of the borderline placement goes back to the student - how much time and energy is he willing and interested in investing in the study of math.  At the high school level I have had this discussion with kids very openly.  _x0007_I may recommend a more advanced class, and they say they want to spend more time studying literature or psychology, that their interest is not in mathematics.  Great - let me help you get what you need._x0007_On the other hand, I have had students really lobby to be in a more challenging placement.  90% of the time they were correct and exceeded my expectations.  I think it is important to respect the learner.  To let them have a voice in the decision making process._x0007__x0007_Similarly, this year in my new school we have two levels \\\\college prep\\\\\" and \\\\\"honors\\\\\".  Many of my college prep geometry students asked to move into the honors level next class - now this is tricky because I don\\'t truly know how solid their algebra skills are (I have some idea, but not the whole picture)nor do I really know the difference between the classes as this is a new school for me - but I asked my students 3 questions:_x0007_(1) Are you willing to put in extra time as needed to learn the material?_x0007_(2) Are you willing to accept a grade that is not an \\\\\"A\\\\\" - as you may find it difficult at first making the adjustment?_x0007_(3) Are you willing to seek extra help - either through your teacher, tutor, or even me?_x0007__x0007_If they could answer yes to all three then I recommended the honors class.  Not sure how our department head will feel about that, but you know, if the student is willing to struggle a little, then we should let them struggle.  I know that those honors teachers will keep their break-neck speed for the higher students and any kid that showed interest in moving up will be fine.  But some of the difference in 2 levels goes to allowing for some choice at the high school level.  They don\\'t have choice as to whether or not they take mathematics, however it is helpful to have choice in how much time/energy they would like to give to the different subjects.\"'}],\n",

Often, if someone catches a mistake I\\'m making, I give them a point,and invite them up to show us their thinking.

Answer only one number and label the following text: I was teaching in such a school last year and reprimanded for giving work that was too difficult to a lower set. Yet the lesson was based on work they would be tested on for their foundation GCSE paper, a paper that if they got perfect on they could only achieve the mark of C because challenging questions were not included on the test that would allow a student to \\\\break out\\\\\" of the set they were placed in. If students do not get exposed to work they will be tested on, how will they do well on their GCSE? It is setting them up for failure. I found it a bit reminiscent of the Indian caste system. I think the class system is so engrained in England they don\\'t even recognize that they are training students to be an underclass. I found the last sentence interesting ( and correct!) Every class has to be differentiated anyway, so either students are in the wrong set OR if each lesson is differentiated, what is the need for sets? Just use more open ended problems that can be accessed on many levels. Students could have different classmates in each lesson and have a greater variety of friends, and exposure to a greater variety of ideas, instead of having the same students in all their classes.\"'}],\n",

Answer only one number and label the following text: Teaching students the way they will be tested is a research-based principle. Kudos to you! Study guides with procedures? Not everything has to be a problem-based learning. Indeed, much research suggests that problem-based learning works better if a student has background knowledge. Notice, no where did I say that the problem-based learning needs to be exactly like the procedures already taught. By giving students a path, they can be prepared to think deeper and in a different way. Also, repeated attempts at the same procedures in novel concepts increases memorization and understanding. _x0007__x0007_There should be a mix! So many want to act like worksheets are fake and problem-based learning is authentic. Learning comes in all different styles and methods; for example, Japan does a great deal of memorization before problem-based learning. Other countries, like Germany, do very little problem-based learning. Yet, both countries are at the top of the world's math tests. The point is that like solving a math problem, there are several paths to teaching.\"}],\n",

I had (male) teachers who told me that girls were naturally less good at math than boys, and while at the time I resented and sought to overcome that stereotype I also think I internalized it to some extent. I was in fact so intimidated by math that I avoided it at all costs in college (which I was largely able to do because of a major that only required econ and statistics). Anyway, many years later I am now at a place in my life where I no longer have external performance pressure regarding math, and I'm ready to engage with it again.

Answer only one number and label the following text: Being a Math Teacher and obvious former student of high school, college and grad school math courses.  I started off struggling with math in high school.  It was very difficult for me and I had to work hard at it which looking back I attribute my more eventual learning of the subject (if that can be said).  But some time in college, I seemed to have a better grasp of the subject.  I feel like to be successful in math(or any subject) is that you have to have an inquiry for it (which we are all born with), it must be presented in a way that is somewhat accesible and there has to be some perseverance and \\\\risk taking\\\\\" on the part of the student.  In my classroom, I try to stoke the inquiry by presenting problems that are accessible and somewhat open ended. But getting student\\'s to take a risk, try the problem for an hour or day can be tough because they have been conditioned to think that solving a math problem is something on the magnitude of minutes rather than hours or even days.  So it comes as no surprise that completion level of college math is low.  By the time they get to those classes, the inquiry and fun has been driven out of them in favor of a quick solution that you either get or don\\'t and this idea of toughness/perseverance is non-existant.  My goal as a math teacher is to try to build this back up and encourage the risk taking.\"'}],\n",

The real power of the number talk was to dig into how students are solving problems and making sense of the number. During the discussion, the teacher is drawing a visual to help students 'see' the number as well as writing the number sentence that makes it up. Very powerful. It helps make numbers concrete.\"}],\n",

When talking to teachers and administrators and the bean counters things start to break down. It seems it is usually left up to an individual teacher who is willing to put the effort in to break away from this mould, hardly ever a concerted policy or whole system approach. It is very convenient from, a bean counting perspective, to have all the kids nicely categorised and grouped so that they go through the nicely organised day that starts with a bell ringing at 9:00 am then every 50 minutes after that - just like the work and world of the future will be if we were living in the 1800s!!! Hopefully the system will change to meet the changing needs of education for the future rather than educating for the stone age. To many people protecting their own little patch and too few really concerned with looking at how education, maths among all subjects, should change.

(When the second person after Joe gave the answer as 725, not 730 she did not ask this girl to explain her thinking.  The lesson started with a great mistake.)  Cathy asked the class to respond to Joe's method, and Julio gave a different (quarters) view of the same procedure.  Each time the students talked about their method, she wrote it on the board, giving them 'permission' to break numbers down in different ways.

Also I would hope that it would lead to grouping numbers mentally so that they don't have to think of numbers one by one but they would start to see number patterns and again compress this to simplify their thinking.  For example 3+2 is always going to be 5 so you can start with the bigger number 5 to 'jumpstart' the process.

The teacher continually sought multiple ways of seeing the solution, and modeled the representation of their thinking visually on the board. She encouraged the student who recognized his mistake to share it - talk through it, which he did comfortably; evidently the culture of this classroom highlights mistakes as a welcomed/important part of the learning experience. The teacher also represented on the board in numbers/operations and in pictorial graphs student thinking as the deconstruction of numbers and then again as the flexible rearrangement of them. She asked critical thinking questions of her students, while she showed on the board many ways to think about solving the problem as well as the many solutions that students came up with. Students were asked which property their problem solving strategies and number sentences reflected, given time to talk it over within small groups. The teacher also did not rush her students thinking; she gave them time to think through their answers.'}],\n",

Not sure how we can address this demand with all these cultural messages coming at us in the US. _x0007__x0007_Even teachers who teach these high groups, feel proud of this assignment. Many teachers of high groups also seem to believe that no child should struggle in their classes. If the student is struggling or failing tests, the child is in the wrong class etc...and the teacher is not thinking about how he/she might be able to teach better. _x0007__x0007_Also, if you set a bar, someone will demand an advanced level. Used to be Algebra 1 was a high school class - very few demanded Algebra 1 in 7th grade. When Algebra 1 became an 8th grade class, 7th grade Algebra became a common class in most middle schools.Now even with the Common Core, I hear of schools who have started early to change their math courses have advanced - only a very few- 6th graders to 7th grade classes - and we have not even implemented this yet. With these math advancements of our youth, college math professors still complain about what knowledge students come in with to their universities._x0007__x0007_Recently, I heard a high school senior say that a University application asked him to list advanced middle school math courses he took.

Do these students that barely pass a class have the appropriate understanding in order to process more advanced material?  So in a way it is the teaching methods of the courses.  But where does it start?_x0007__x0007_It all starts from a lack of foundational knowledge and that can start all the way down in elementary school.  Once a student falls behind, that student will almost always be left behind because he/she is playing catch-up.  These students will feel like they are rushing through the material and are never given the chance to slow down and build some foundation.  By the time they reach college and have to take remedial courses, they will have been discouraged to continue, because why even try if you can't even pass a remedial course in college?\"}],\n",

I have yet to see a model of flexible grouping where the teacher doesn't spend hours each week. If we are to use homogeneous groupings then I have a lot of questions.  Specifically, how do you move the students from one group to the other, how does the teacher keep track of the individual needs and then group the students, what is an organized way that will not take hours every week to redo the groups, etc.?  How do we convince administrators of this type of grouping? However, my biggest concern with this is that one or two students from the group end up doing most of the work.  So I would need to see this in action to see how the teacher monitors and makes sure that all students have a growth mind set.\"}],\n",

Language used by teachers (all staff that work with children).  How we communicate to students is at the foundation of this change in mindset.   If change would occur than all staff that worked with students would have to change their communication to students whether or not they agreed with the idea.

Answer only one number and label the following text: I\\'d like to push back a little on what you said. I think what the course is trying to show us is that even though students may perform better in the short term when grouped by ability, it has long term negative impacts on their learning. What we need to do is plan classroom activities that allow all students to participate, but by design, the activities let each student take part \\\\at their level\\\\\". For example, in the division problem shown earlier in this session, the teacher didn\\'t group the students by ability. Instead, everyone got the same problem and the same task, \\\\\"Make sense of this division problem.\\\\\" They all approached it differently, and even students who were \\\\\"advanced\\\\\" and already knew the algorithm were still challenged to understand how other students were solving the problem. That\\'s just one example of differentiation. It takes more planning on the part of the teacher, but once she is experienced with it, it will be much easier and the students will benefit more in the long term.\"'}],\n",

It\\'s difficult though and you can see it on their faces when they\\'ve worked so hard. The problem with the extended classes for these bright, wonderful thinkers is how fast they crack through the content. I\\'ve had wonderful middle schoolers unravel in HS maths because there was no time to breathe let alone think or try to solve something a different way. I saw them again two years later and had to restore their mathematical belief in themselves. These extended classes (depending on the school I suppose) support rapidity. It\\'s a big problem in Grade 10 when the teachers have to submit, by March assessments using all of the criteria and this must include a test. _x0007__x0007_I will be teaching in a small school so no grouping is possible.

They did not have a positive feeling about mathematics or themselves as learners or being smart. We had some discussions about what had been covered, progress, was there anything they had enjoyed that year (I came in half way through) and if not what about any year before that?_x0007__x0007_Their test scores were very low and everyone sat the same final exam (in grade 8!). _x0007_They seemed to agree that shapes and geometry were okay so I suggested we look at it in depth and ignore the rest unless we found the time. I told them we would all learn something really well rather than trying to get through all of it. They agreed. _x0007_Of course there is numeracy and algebra in geometry, but I didn\\'t call it that, they were just tools to solve problems. Out of seven classes, our class came fourth (averages).

I will have them work on open-ended puzzles and problems that are difficult and can be solved in different ways.

Answer only one number and label the following text: One thing that has worked in my elementary school is the introduction of daily word problems.  Our administration believes that using math story problems in our classrooms can give every student a chance to develop understanding of basic math concepts.  This has been highly successful.  First, we introduce a real life situation based on our math objective.  We then have the students tell each other the story and what the specific task is.  We then have the students use unifix cubes, drawings, numerical representations of how they solve the problem, using at least one representation that can be put down on paper.  This lets all level of achievers to use whatever forum they want. When higher students finish, we give them the task to solve it another way and show their thinking. As students work individually, the teacher goes around and asks students what they are showing (how they are making sense of their thinking) and selects three students to present their strategies to the class.  These presentations are to be from simple to more complex so that all students can see/relate their thinking to another way of solving the problem.  This has been highly successful in our school practices and has shown us that all students can do math.  I found that at the end of doing this for an entire year, most if not all students were able to express their math thinking with ease and were more than eager to share and be presenters to the class.  I noticed doing daily math word problems also obliterated the anxiety that often accompanies such problems.  Last year, one of my students exclaimed, \\\\I\\'m not afraid of story problems anymore.\\\\\"  This was all the proof I needed.  I\\'m continuing this practice!\"'}],\n",

Not just a fascinating research class, but very applicable to our understanding of how the brain learns. It was invaluable. In my pursuit of knowledge on this subject, I found a class taught through University of La Verne that relates to the understanding of this and allows you to apply the information much how a student would in your classroom. It is an Art class called Right Brain Learning.It was interesting how the information can apply to other areas of learning.As an educator, it is vital that administrators and our partners in education learn to use the information to extend learning with in our required Common Core Curriculum.'}],\n",

The idea that students are not good at math or that is a difficult subject is so societal in nature and reflects back on families, schools and communities. The message used to be more gender based in that it was more difficult for girls than boys. but I think that mindset is shifting, albeit quite slowly.The pressure for math comes from the arbitrary expectation that everyone is a linear thinker and can process mathematical concepts in a set time format and at a pace set by school administrators. Dr. Montessori was a leading reformist in this thought and developed a three year cycle following the developmental needs and tendencies for students. She developed great math and geometry materials that enables learners to learn kinesthetically through the manipulation of materials._x0007_<nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>'}],\n",

Systems that are set up to allow for more effort to let a student dig himself out of a hole should be rewarded.  I set up such a system last year, and received poor ratings on observation since what we were doing did not fit the mold.  The average of the students in my math classes jumped from the 32nd percentile to the 39th percentile.  It was new and confusing for me and parents and administrators, but I feel an obligation knowing how to allow students to be rewarded for their effort to employ that method.

However, I pushed each kid to read at home and retested the child every 2-3 weeks. Kids who were reading at home and putting in effort, moved up in level and became very proud of their achievement. I think kids have a lower overall achievement because most teachers are not pushing for growth in the groupings. It seems that grades tell kids they are smart if they have A\\'s and dumb if they have F\\'s. If we put kids into ability groups, than the lower group knows they are not as smart and then accepts their lot in life._x0007__x0007_However, I am now teaching 7th grade instead of 4th grade.

As a consultant, I meet such hard-working teachers who are desperate to do the best by their students but are stuck due to the 'You don't know what you don't know' effect. Teachers merely re-produce their own education and, in most cases, the necessary pedagogy and subject knowledge required to ensure students really understand, appreciate an can use and apply their maths is missing. When teachers are given the opportunity to see how teaching maths from meaningful starting points engages learners and gives them a reason to develop specific skills, they come alive with enthusiasm. Many say 'If only I'd learned maths like this' and 'I'm not rubbish at maths but I thought I was'. What a wonderful opportunity we have to do things differently for our students who are in our care now when you begin to 'Know what you know' instead.\"}],\n",

I see more challenges in motivating them because I cannot point out as many great peer successes.
