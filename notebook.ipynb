Answer only one number and label the following text: EP101 Staff: Your wish is our command :)  There will be a little bit on this topic in the bonus module in the aging section title \\\\exercise and the common cold\\\\\". It was part of the physical activity, disease and aging section, but was moved out to its own section because the original lecture was getting too long.  The bottom line is that infections go up in the winter because of the short, cold, dry days which help viruses survive and the reduction in Vit D formed in the skin by the sun. Also, everyone is stuck together inside spreading germs.  There seems to be mixed data on whether cold increases risk of infection.  That idea was \\\\\"debugged\\\\\" some time ago, but some more recent evidence suggests that maybe the cold,dry air irritates the ventilatory passages of athletes training outdoors which make them more susceptible to infections. Once you have a cold, I like CanBahtiyar\\'s brainstorming above: More heat loss with a fever and divided resources.\"'}],\n",

You are sacrificing your ability to exercise efficiently to keep yourself warm.  Uncoupling is thought to happen somewhat after prolonged exercise as well especially with a rise in core temperature, high free fatty acids, norepinephrine, sequestration of calcium in mitochondria and some other things which all may impact the energy production pathways negatively in the electron transport chain. It may explain partially why metabolic rate remains elevated after exercise (called excess post-exercise oxygen consumption or EPOC) even when other things in the body seem to have returned to normal.'}],\n",

Answer only one number and label the following text: In the early 1990s, there was a theory that cold baths might help individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome (also known in the UK as ME or myalgic encephalomyelitis). I think it was put forward by a reputable medical doctor, I think Dr Vijay Kakkar. You had to sit in a cold bath every 1 or 2 days I think, with the duration of sitting in there extending by 1 or 2 minutes each time. I think the theory was to do with resetting or influencing the hypothalamus._x0007__x0007_It was a bit controversial with people worrying that sitting already ill people in cold water could make things worse for them. But a few people, including the Dr himself I think, said it was beneficial for them. Others didn't find it helpful. It doesn't seem to have caught on or been researched much more since as far as I can tell from a quick search on the internet._x0007__x0007_However, there was one aspect that always intrigued me. I tried the method myself for a few weeks and I noticed that about 3-4 hours after getting out of the cold bath I would experience a sudden intense rush of warmness all over my body for a couple of minutes. It was a bit like a hot flush I imagine, though it was not uncomfortably hot and did not provoke sweating. It was so noticeable that the first time I looked round to see if other people had also just experienced something changing in the environment, only to realize that it was only me. It was actually quite nice, an extremely cozy sort of warmth - so nice it would have been lovely if it had continued for longer. This occurred despite the fact that I had never felt cold after getting dressed from the bath and had been feeling warm and in a perfectly warm environment for at least 2-3 hours before the warm surge arrived. And the timing was remarkably predictable. I have always been very curious to understand more about the physiology of this effect and would be interested to hear if anyone has heard of this before, and has any explanation. If it is not known, perhaps understanding this might help our understanding of the body's thermoregulatory control mechanisms._x0007__x0007_PS. The niceness of the warm surge was not quite enough to outweigh the unpleasantness of sitting in a cold bath!_x0007__x0007_A couple of related sites I found on the internet as a starting point in case anyone wants to look into this further..._x0007_http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-05-18/news/1<phoneRedac>53_1_cold-baths-kakkar-schools-for-boys_x0007__x0007_http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC<phoneRedac>/\"}],\n",

Regardless of the type of intense activity an individual the amount of oxygen remains the same since both values have increased. Is that correct?

Very low ambient temperature is one important factor to keep in mind when considering risk of hypothermia. But there are others as well, and it doesn't have to be frostbite cold to be at risk for lowering core temperature to unsafe levels. Other environmental factors (e.g. high wind), and individual characteristics (e.g. surface area to volume ratio, subcutaneous fat, ability to generate heat, and ability to vasoconstrict peripheral vessels) play a role in how quickly heat will be extracted and how much core temperature will drop in a given situation.  _x0007_-Staff\"}],\n",

I simply couldn't change gears by the end, my hands just wouldn't work.

I know a number of fell runners in their 60s and 70s who have no problem racing at a high standard in both heat and cold. The assumption that all older people experience the same problems often works against the interests of the more athletic, ignoring real illness and injury just because they happen to be fitter and more mobile than a stereotype.'}],\n",

As we would be out there for upwards of 4 hours, staying warm was crucial. Aside from being covered in wool from head to toe below our wetsuits, the team of guides would gather at a local diner for a hearty breakfast filled with eggs, bacon, and some carbs and hot drinks. While it wasn't the best choice for normal days, we would use this high protein intake to warm our bodies and sort of pre-load them with some heat since the thermic effect of protein is significantly greater than carbohydrate or fat. This would get us through water temps of 40 degrees and air temps that hovered around freezing.\"}],\n",

As an example, acting tough and staying calm seems to be what allows mountaineers to endure and survive extremely cold conditions. On the other hand self-consciousness might make someone less capable of enduring the cold, perhaps due to energy being wasted on anxiety rather than spent more efficiently on a task at hand whether it be tying shoelaces, or pitching a tent so you can get protection from a storm and warm up._x0007_ _x0007_In the 'Corey warms up' video there is some talk of reduced cognitive capacity. What I haven't heard mentioned yet - although I'm sure it will come up - is the ability of cold to cause physical pain especially in the hands and feet, or its ability to very quickly have a negative affect one's mood.

Answer only one number and label the following text: Hi there. Not yet doing the homework, haha; but i have some ideas about your discussion._x0007__x0007_I don't think the subject will use less oxygen. The adaptation in athletes come to happen in the hearth, reducing the cardiac frequence and sometimes even increasing the size of the hearth; this is because the constant hypoxia in the working muscles makes the capillaries to increase their numbers, so in a relaxed situation there's more perfussion, so the same oxygen (or even more if the energy requirement of the muscles increase due to hypertrofia) travels the circulatory system in less time and more efficiently, so the heart has to work less._x0007__x0007_The metabolism adaptation you mention, i don't know if you meant a mollecular level, but i don't think that's the case. There's no way to improve the chemical reactions required to synthetize ATP; in fact the only way for the mitochondria to adapt is to increase the enzymes required for the synthesis and with that the oxygen requirement also increases. In a chronic cold adaptation, that's what happen, the mitochondria makes more and more reactions so the number of enzymes increases, the requirement of oxygen increases and the respiratory frequency increases. It might happen, just as the adaptation to high altittude, that the chronic hypoxia increases the number of red cells and capillaries, so the gas exchange in the lungs becomes more efficient, and this way the respiratory frequency can drop, even though the oxygen consumption increases._x0007__x0007_Well, anyway, I hope this is useful. Sorry for bad english, haha. Greetings from the South.\"}],\n",

Initially the core temperature is maintained (whether water or air or under snow) by Vascular Regulation. This will happen for a shorter time of exposure and in Corey's case he was removed from the water after a while to avoid the stage where his core temp starts to drop._x0007__x0007_When on the treadmill, Corey's core temperature started to drop drastically as the blood flow increased to his active limbs - legs, arms etc. This forced the vascular regulation to allow blood to the muscles under exercise. The feeling of cold intensified, resulting in shivering and of course there was faster drop in core temperature._x0007__x0007_However, your conclusion is correct that the loss of heat is faster in water than air.

As a health science student and personal trainer I'm finding the information very relevant and explained at a level that builds upon my current knowledge of anatomy and physiology, but I can not seem to start the videos from different places in the lecture. I wanted to review and study the Fick equation more because it went by pretty quickly in the lecture, but each time I cued the video to the slide where  Dr. Friedlander explains how the equation works, the video restarted from the beginning when I hit play. Is there a trick so I can re-watch sections of the lecture without starting from the beginning?\"}],\n",

It is much less invasive than a nasogastric tube and doesn't go all the way to his stomach. It is used frequently in research with no ill effect.  It is not easy to get in, but not painful.

It is true that the impact of heat loss through the head had been exaggerated for years - it use to be thought that 80% of body heat was lost through the head, which is not true.  Still, it remains a major source of heat loss.  As an appendage sticking out in the cold with lots of blood vessels that you can't constrict (because your brain would not be happy with that), there is heat lost to the environment. Hair helps, but a good hat helps more. If you are out in the cold, carrying or using a hat makes sense, just like having gloves and keeping your chest covered.  As I said in an earlier post, I wouldn't trade the rest of my clothes for a single hat, but having a hat really helps as additional coverage.\"}],\n",

Is it true that you can still be at risk for hypothermia if your body temperature drops drastically & quickly even if the temperature is really warm or even hot around you? For instance after working out, I know an improper cool-down risks the pooling of blood.

This heat gradient does not reverse immediately upon initiation of rewarming. Until the gradient is reversed, further heat transfer occurs from the warmer core to cooler peripheral tissues. This mechanism is supported by the observation that afterdrop has been demonstrated in a frozen leg of beef and a cooled bag of gelatin.\\\\\"\"'}],\n",

Answer only one number and label the following text: Interesting riddle. Here's my thoughts. Your base layer was cotton, which doesn't wick sweat away from your skin at all because it is hydrophillic and easily absorbs water. Your second layer, wool, was a good insulator (a common insulator like fleece) to the point that it caused you to perspire. Your perspiration could not be wicked away from your skin. Both the moisture trapped on your skin as well as that moisture being exposed to the air lowered your body temperature. When you removed the sweater, you were no longer so warm that you perspired leaving no moisture directly on the skin. So, even though you had a loose cotton T-shirt as your base layer, there was no moisture trapped on the skin being exposed to air. As such, you felt warmer without the wool insulator. My last thought, if you felt warmer without the wool vs with the wool but still felt cold overall, using a better base layer than a cotton shirt would have made all the difference. I know a lot about snow-sport base layers due to snowboarding but was surprised that there are base layers made specifically for motorcyclists that are both wicking and tight fitting, which would keep moisture off your skin and increase that air pocket you were talking about.\"}],\n",

Thank you for posting this. I am currently unemployed and in the process of changing careers. For nearly 17 years I worked for <redacted> <redacted>. This company is the largest manufacturer of hard disc drives. My background is Mathematics and Statistics and was employed in this area working directly with engineers from all disciplines studying drive performance and reliability. Drives are tested all throughout their manufacturing process. So, there was always data available for analysis. We also performed and analyzed design of experiments (DOE). In fact, while at Seagate I earned my Six Sigma Master Black Belt certification and became the focal point for Business Excellence which included developing Business Intelligence dashboards for engineering and management. This allowed me to use my MBA. I am taking this course to brush up on my Statistics again and update my resume for a career in Big Data. At this point in time, I am unsure if I will end up back in high-tech, or will be able to switch to something new like academia, market research, or.... It's very exciting to think of the possibilities. Good Luck.\"}],\n",

These people have developed an amazing ability to cope with cold at a very deep physiological level as far as I could tell.'}],\n",

They described the physiology behind her survival. From what I remember the key point was that her body temperature was lowered (and hence the reducing metabolism of her tissues including the brain) while she still had blood circulation and probably was breathing in an air-pocket under the ice. From the moment she was hauled from under the ice she recieved CPR. That way she never suffered from any brain damage. _x0007__x0007_A scientific report on the case was published in Lancet (Resuscitation from accidental hypothermia of 13.7 degrees C with circulatory arrest.

Some researchers say that exercise will increase brown adipose tissue, but if you think about it, that seems backwards in some ways.  BAT means that your energy production pathways are less efficient and that is not good for exercise.  But maybe, you can turn it on and off. That would be ideal.  _x0007_Most agree that there is likely a genetic component.

Answer only one number and label the following text: From what I understand, a lot of research is going on in this field right now- how to make additional BAT, how to change beige adipose to brown, etc. Researchers have succeeded in growing mature human brown fat cells from preadipocytes that were taken from a fresh sample of brown fat from a patient having neck surgery. From what I have read, researchers havent found a way yet to essentially make more BAT. _x0007__x0007_BAT is able to produce large amounts of heat through activation of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). When UCP1 is activated, it allows a free-flow of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, resulting in the rapid release of chemical energy as heat. BAT is most abundant in adults in the deep regions of the neck and chest- close to the sympathetic chain and carotid arteries where is can quickly warm the blood and raise core body temperature._x0007__x0007_When rolling in the snow or taking cold showers (cold-induced thermogenseis), I believe the theory is not to make new BAT but to activate the adults current stores of BAT. When it is cold out, or your body gets cold your core temperature drops. Your muscles help raise your core temp by shivering. Your bodys thermoregulatory functions activate BAT which activates UCP1 thus releasing chemical energy as heat. This process burns white adipose tissue, improves blood circulation and increases your metabolism theoretically helping you to lose weight.'}],\n",

Answer only one number and label the following text: Staff: You bring up an interesting dilemma that happens frequently in physiology: sacrificing something longer term for immediate survival.  By increasing the activity of BAT, you do burn more calories which could be a problem down the road, but you need additional heat right now!  If you didn't increase metabolic rate and increase heat production, core temperature would fall more and you would get hypothermic faster.  At least, by keeping you warm in the short-term, you have a chance of getting rescued and eating more food in the future.  If you die sooner from hypothermia by saving your energy for later, that doesn't help much. _x0007__x0007_There are lots of other examples of this in the body, such as breaking down lean mass to supply short term energy supplies when your carbohydrate stores are depleted during exercise.  You will have to put a lot of energy in later to replace that lean mass, but you need the energy now.\"}],\n",

Answer only one number and label the following text: Thanks for the answer. Well, Guyton writes a bit about adaptation to cold, and aknowledge that the behavioral adaptation is way more important than peopole used to think back in the days. But he specifically talks about the increase in tiroxin and the discoupling of the respiratory chain, also increased metabolism makes people feel more hungry and more often. And just remembered this, he says we have a lot more of cold sensors in the skin than heat sensors, but i think this makes sense since we're tropical animals, and really need to feel cold before it gets into our heads._x0007__x0007_Anyway, this adaptation takes weeks. But he doesn't says much about adaptation to heat, and doesn't give a time. Silbernagl in the other hand, is the opposite; he says that physiological adaptation to heat takes years, but doesn't say a thing about the time required to cold adaptation. The adaptation Silbernagl writes about consist in theincrease of activity in colinergic fibers, the work by sudoripary glands increase so salts are reabsorbed more efficiently and increase of thirst._x0007__x0007_Sorry about my bad english, hope you can understand what i'm writing!\"}],\n",

Answer only one number and label the following text: My husband has just about no fat on his body.  He went to a major research center a few years ago and all they could tell him after all the testing and review of the literature from everywhere was that it was probably his metabolism.  He's always figured he can't fill the fat cells he has; his metabolism is too high.  If he doesn't eat almost constantly, he burns muscle (he lost nine pounds in five days in the hospital when they had him on restricted diets -- not good for someone in his 70's who can't build muscle so easily).  Some people want to **gain** weight!_x0007__x0007_Anyway, until a few years ago when he started taking amphetamines for his ADHD, he never felt the heat.  Now, he does (although not badly); but I have no idea if this is in any way related to brown adipose tissue.   I'm thinking that it's possible he has a high metabolism for some reason, can't fill fat cells because of this, and has some brown adipose which is now in a much higher ratio to white adipose than is normal.  Thoughts?\"}],\n",

Answer only one number and label the following text: Interesting thread. I powerlift and the elite athletes where I train make use of the ice bath for recovery. However, I have observed much mixed opinion about the relative benefits of these immediately after a workout for recovery. A study from the University of Portsmouth published in the European Journal of Sport Science found that ice baths are no more or less effective than a good post workout cooldown exercise. My personal experience is that they stiffen me up. I prefer to cooldown and then at night before bed to have a very hot bath with epsom  salts (magnesium salts) to help muscle recovery. I do use ice when injured as part of the RICE regimen (rest, ice, compression, elevation) but for no more than 15-20 mins max at a time.'}],\n",

The outside temperature will be maybe only 4c but I feel profoundly cold in the core of my bones. Conversely in Europe I feel the cold in my skin and soft tissue rather than my bones. The temperature is often much lower than I've experienced in Africa (i.e. below 0c). I would be very interested to understand why this occurs and the scientific basis of this. Is it due to the higher levels of humidity in the air?\"}],\n",

Because beta hat (p+1) only affects one game, that is exactly what I'll do._x0007__x0007_But then, minimizing RSS over all n+1 games just reduces to minimizing RSS over the first n games, and then choosing beta hat (p+1) to make the last residual 0.\"}],\n",

Point is that air density plays a gigantic role in the creation of energy at least in combustion engines. How does air density affect Vo2 given the variables, barometric pressure, temperature and altitude. Seems like these variables would have an instantaneous affect on V02 when ever conditions change. For example traveling to Death Valley in the winter to race (very dense air)after training in Denver during the summer(Low dense air). Be fun to do these studies using a Hyperbaric chamber.'}],\n",

HST consisted 1<zipRedac>-min rowing at 3<zipRedac>% peak power output (PPO), 1<zipRedac> min at 6<zipRedac>% PPO and 5-min rest before a 2-km performance test, without feedback cues.

Body mass loss during acclimation bouts was 1.6  <zipRedac>.3 kg (2.1%) on day 1 and 2.3  <zipRedac>.4 kg (3.<zipRedac>%) on day 5. In contrast, resting plasma volume increased by 4.5  4.5% from day 1 to 5 (estimated from [Hb] & Hct). Plasma aldosterone increased at rest (52.6 pg mL(-1); p = <zipRedac>.<zipRedac>3) and end-exercise (162.4 pg mL(-1); p = <zipRedac>.<zipRedac><zipRedac>) from day 1 to 5 acclimation. During the HST T(re) and f(c) were lowered <zipRedac>.3 C (p = <zipRedac>.<zipRedac><zipRedac>) and 14 b min(-1) (p = <zipRedac>.<zipRedac><zipRedac>) after 2<zipRedac>-min exercise. The 2-km performance time (6.52.7 min) improved by 4 s (p = <zipRedac>.<zipRedac><zipRedac>). Meaningful physiological and performance improvements occurred for highly trained athletes using a short-term (5-day) heat acclimation under hyperthermia control, with dehydration._x0007__x0007_**Take this with caution.

This happens a LOT of times per second, making the total energy loss considerable._x0007_So, the higher the density, more molecules to bump into you!_x0007_That also explains why the wind takes heat more efficiently.

The challenge is for a single person to finish the whole thing in less than 30 minutes. We weren't crazy enough to attempt that, but me, my wife, and my three kids decided that we just wanted to finish the whole thing. That didn't happen._x0007__x0007_By about half way through the mountain of ice cream most of the fam faded, but I was determined to keep eating. About 20 or 30 minutes in, though, the craziest thing happened. An icy cold started in my stomach and slowly crept throughout my body. I was being cooled from the inside out! After a few moments I got goosebumps and the shivers. I stopped eating and warmed back up again, and then spent the rest of the day (including a Golden State Warriors basketball game) feeling awful. _x0007__x0007_So, from what I can gather, my core temp plummeted from the inside-out!

Answer only one number and label the following text: Q: At the same submaximal workload on an exercise bike before and after endurance training, you will use:_x0007__x0007_A: The same amount of oxygen._x0007__x0007_The concept of a submax workload and oxygen consumption is tricky, and often students in our class at Stanford have trouble with it before it clicks. So know your confusion is in good company. _x0007__x0007_Lets see if I can be helpful. The main point is this: **it requires the same amount of oxygen for your body to do a certain amount of work.** If that work is below the maximal capacity, we call it a submax workload. For example, I did a few months of cycling training to increase my aerobic fitness a year or so back as a part of a previous teaching project. We tested my VO2max by doing a progressive (increasing workload every few minutes) test on a stationary bike where I wore a mask that measured the oxygen I was using at Week 0, Week 5, and Week 10 of my training regimen. My VO2max increased across my 10 week training program because my body had optimized components of the fick equation, meaning that I could finish the test at a later stage where I cycled at higher watts of resistance. Lets say at Week 0 my maximum resistance at the end of the test was 250 watts, but at Week 10 it was 350 watts. Because of my training, I was becoming a better cyclist! Here is the point. Regardless of my training and assuming my cycling technique didn't change, at 150 watts (a light, submaximal workload), my body needed to consume the same amount of oxygen at Week 0 Week 5 and Week 10 to do 150 watts of work. The difference is, at the end of the training, my body could consume more oxygen, and 150 watts of a submaximal workload was easier because it was a lower percentage of my overall VO2max. _x0007_-Staff\"}],\n",

Answer only one number and label the following text: Immersion in a tepid bath had long been the accepted means, along with medication, of quickly reducing dangerously high fevers in infants and toddlers in the ED. The primary problem with this method was that the children/ infants usually responded to the immersion with heat generating behaviors such as vigorous flailing about in the water and nonstop crying. In an attempt to eliminate, or minimize this counterproductive behavior, we began to drape our little patients with wet towels and place a fan in front of them. This evaporative cooling method proved very successful. The infants and children usually remained calm and fever reduction occurred even more rapidly than with the immersion method. Also, with our patients in a calm state, it was easier to notice when they began to shiver, thus signaling when to stop the cooling measure. Another indirect benefit of the evaporative cooling method was that parents were more willing to do this at home, if necessary, because they were much less likely to have to deal with a screaming, stressed out infant.'}],\n",

Being with an outer insulation that shelters the body from wind, cold rain, and other external conditions that may take away heat from the body. (In lay person terms, keep the cold out.) Thereafter, dress in layers, keeping in mind that each layer is an insulator onto its own, plus the airgap in between also further insulates. Finally, the base layer, the layer closest to your skin, should fit snuggly against your skin. It should also wick away your perspiration. As we learned in this section, wet perspiration will conduct heat away from your body faster than simple cold air. Personally for the base layer I prefer polypropylene fiber materials, but you can also use silk, which is deliciously oh-so-expensive._x0007__x0007_There are other considerations to take into account in addition to thermal insulation, including mobility, cost, and of course appearance!'}],\n",

Answer only one number and label the following text: Staff: Hello Everyone, _x0007_Nice work catching our attention with all your great posts!  You have the right idea on the theory of ice bath: reduced inflammation, increased constriction, followed by increased flow to the tissues (called reactive hyperemia:  when the circulation is slowed or cut off to an area the blood then returns afterwards at a higher rate to flush out waste products and deliver nutrients).  You are also accurate in your discussion of the mixed results.  Despite the fact that some athletes and coaches swear by it, there is no consistent data that suggests that it is better than other (less painful) cool downs - such as a light active cool down.  IF you have an actual injury than the reduction in inflammation can be beneficial, but you'd could also achieve that with a more localized application of cold.  Having said that though, there are a lot of things out there that seem to work for individuals that are hard to support with scientific data - meaning when you combine a group together, the positive, neutral and negative responders cancel each other out. I'm not great in the cold, so I personally would not suffer through it for the degree of benefit that has been indicated. But, if you think it is working for you, I wouldn't stop doing it either. Sorry if that sounds wishy washy, but sometimes in physiology the individual response is the most important. You will find that is true for altitude training as well.  It seems to work for some, but not others (although in that case we have a slightly better idea of why...).  If you are a positive responder then altitude training can give you that 2% benefit you need. If you are not, it could actually make you worse. _x0007_Keep up the great discussions. There are a lot of very well informed people out there!\"}],\n",

Here is a little \\\\cold\\\\\" adventure we had there when our children were in their early teens._x0007__x0007_On an end of the summer outing with our 24\\' sailboat on Yellowstone Lake, we were caught by an unexpected \\\\\"Nor\\'easter\\\\\" that was bringing an early fall snowstorm to the park. We had stopped for a picnic on Frank Island and our boat was tied up on a summer-only dock. The air temperature fell rapidly and the lake water was very rough with wind waves. As the winds increased, the mooring lines were snapping and the dock was breaking apart. My husband and son started the motor and our daughter and I cast of the remaining lines so they could take the boat out, to avoid having it dashed to pieces on shore by the wind waves. Then my daughter and I crawled back to shore on the violently bucking dock, as parts of it were snapping and breaking off._x0007__x0007_We didn\\'t know how long we would be there, so we decided to set up a small shelter and make a little fire using twigs and dead branches. We always carried a small waterproof container of matches for just such an emergency. _x0007__x0007_The air temperature probably dropped to the low 50\\'s and the wind was really blowing hard. We were discussing whether we would need to spend the night in the outhouse as we sat shivering by our little fire, trying to warm our hands and dry our socks, when we heard someone calling us from afar. It was my husband and son in our boat! They had motored around a rocky point to the lee side of the island where the water was much calmer and had anchored there and were calling us with the boat\\'s hailer. _x0007__x0007_As we waded out in the water toward the boat we were surprised by how warm the water felt. The average water temperature in Yellowstone Lake in the summer ranges between 40 and 50 degrees. At the end of summer it would be at the lower end of that range. But, because we were so chilled from being wet in the cold wind, the water actually seemed warm. We must have been hypothermic by then._x0007__x0007_After warming up in the boat\\'s cabin and changing into dry clothes, we went to a different campsite in a little bay protected from the wind. We cooked dinner and water for hot chocolate in the dark on a little camp stove. Our nice, warm, one-pot dinner  was one of the best I\\'ve ever had!\"'}],\n",

From what I have researched, this is more common in women and can occur with just a small drop of temperature. I have paid attention since I am very active outdoors and also sail in cold waters. I manage this issue by making sure I have warm socks and hand covers, hotties for warming up and basically making sure my extremities are covered in an overkill fashion BEFORE I am starting the activity! I was surprised this was not mentioned in the Cold chapters of this course.  I do now understand it a little better and the physiology behind the blood flow, energy and body function priorities, but have had to do much of my own research on this. Any additional comments would be welcome. _x0007_JT\"}],\n",

So we would talk about types of climbing (bouldering, top rope climbing, lead climbing, and so on) and then test them on their knowledge. Afterward, we (the instructors) concluded we had failed miserably._x0007__x0007_So, in the second class we made a little newsletter in advance to talk about the adventure of climbing. We told little stories that only referred to these types of climbing to \\\\prime the pump.\\\\\" Then when we introduced the instructors on the day of the class, we had each instructor tell a little about their background and a 30-second personal story that featured one of those types of climbing. Later we asked the scouts about the types of climbing. They all knew everything required for the merit badge and enthusiastically volunteered their knowledge - all without a formal lesson._x0007__x0007_It\\'s a powerful tool, but I suspect many people think we outgrow its utility. People seem to think that serious subjects seems to demand serious lectures. Kudos to you for taking the challenge and spending the time to integrate stories in your teaching - both Cory\\'s story each week and in the experiential interviews. They are great._x0007__x0007_Just curious - have you thought at all about how you might measure outcomes in a way that could compare with a more traditional presentation of the same material?

I am finishing my education degree in Manitoba, Canada,  where we have a windchill of -38C/-36F again today :) My focus is on middle years education (grades 6-9). I have a strong interest in teaching science through storytelling and in finding ways to help adolescents learn about human biology. At that age, most young people are very anxious about human biology, but VERY interested in issues of survival and testing the limits. I suspect that environmental physiology may be a way to get them excited about how their bodies work and what human beings are capable of.'}],\n",

After the discussion on hyponatremia, I'm wondering if this has to do with the fact that I drink water more consistently during a hike than I do when I'm running; maybe I am taking in too much water than the exertion level requires?  Our rule of 'thumb' :) on our hikes is 'salt your sausages', meaning that we need to take in more salty food, which also seems to fit with this conclusion.  Once I have stopped hiking, the fingers go back to their normal size within half an hour or so and I am not in any danger of hyponatremia (I don't believe), but it would be nice to find a way to avoid the swelling altogether with my hike diet.  I haven't been able to get the balance right on most of the warmer hikes._x0007__x0007_Am I at least on the right track, in keeping salt levels up when I notice the swelling?\"}],\n",

I would think that swimmers have to work comparatively harder to achieve the same 'heat stress' on the body than athletes in air.

Maybe really excessive training may result in heat exhaustion in very warm water, but I think the coolness of the water is generally enough to remove the heat effectively. However, in this type of exercise, there can be no evaporation as the main cooling mechanism (as shown in the graph) because the environment is 100% humidity.\"}],\n",

Answer only one number and label the following text: In my experience, watching other runners do just what you suggest, to push the pace in a long race early on when the weather is cooler.... they ended up having trouble finishing the race.  You need to manage the race distance. Starting at a faster than race pace to make up for needing to go slow in the heat later on does not work well.  Picture that the weather stayed cool all day: then perhaps you could slow down and gain benefits from it in the second half of the race, since the weather is still reasonable and the slower pace gives you a break.  In your scenario, you do not gain any benefit from the slower pace, it is instead forced on you because of the heat.  After overtaxing yourself early, you would have a much harder time coping with the heat and finding a comfortable pace to get yourself to the finish.'}],\n",

Acclimization obviously is a big factor on adaptability, but it also helps if one learns to use wind variations to help the cooling process.   Even water temperatures in the summer, in open water, will hit 88 - 90 degrees, and has been seen as high as 94 degrees.   One may ask, if the water is that hot how can you swim in it.  Short distances, but not long ones as it will cool the 98.6 temperature.  Great class!'}],\n",

Even though I sweated profusely, my skin remained cool. I made sure to drink lots of water.
